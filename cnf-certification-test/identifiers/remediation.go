	ShutdownRemediation = `
	It's considered best-practices to define prestop for proper management of container lifecycle.
	The prestop can be used to gracefully stop the container and clean resources (e.g., DB connection).
	
	The prestop can be configured using :
	 1) Exec : executes the supplied command inside the container
	 2) HTTP : executes HTTP request against the specified endpoint.
	
	When defined. K8s will handle shutdown of the container using the following:
	1) K8s first execute the preStop hook inside the container.
	2) K8s will wait for a grace period.
	3) K8s will clean the remaining processes using KILL signal.

	PodNodeSelectorAndAffinityBestPracticesRemediation = `In most cases, Pod's should not specify their host Nodes through nodeSelector or nodeAffinity.  However, there are
	cases in which CNFs require specialized hardware specific to a particular class of Node.  As such, this test is purely
	informative, and will not prevent a CNF from being certified. However, one should have an appropriate justification as
