# cnf-certification-test catalog

The catalog for cnf-certification-test contains a variety of `Test Cases`, which are traditional JUnit testcases specified internally using `Ginkgo.It`.
## Test Case Catalog

Test Cases are the specifications used to perform a meaningful test.  Test cases may run once, or several times against several targets.  CNF Certification includes a number of normative and informative tests to ensure CNFs follow best practices.  Here is the list of available Test Cases:

Description|http://test-network-function.com/testcases/lifecycle/pod-scheduling Ensures that CNF Pods do not specify nodeSelector or nodeAffinity.  In most cases, Pods should allow for instantiation on any underlying Node.
Result Type|informative
Suggested Remediation|In most cases, Pod's should not specify their host Nodes through nodeSelector or nodeAffinity.  However, there are 	cases in which CNFs require specialized hardware specific to a particular class of Node.  As such, this test is purely 	informative, and will not prevent a CNF from being certified. However, one should have an appropriate justification as 	to why nodeSelector and/or nodeAffinity is utilized by a CNF.

Description|http://test-network-function.com/testcases/platform-alteration/hugepages-config Checks to see that HugePage settings have been configured through MachineConfig, and not manually on the underlying Node.  This test case applies only to Nodes that are configured with the "worker" MachineConfigSet.  First, the "worker" MachineConfig is polled, and the Hugepage settings are extracted.  Next, the underlying Nodes are polled for configured HugePages through inspection of /proc/meminfo.  The results are compared, and the test passes only if they are the same.
Result Type|normative
Suggested Remediation|HugePage settings should be configured either directly through the MachineConfigOperator or indirectly using the 	PerformanceAddonOperator.  This ensures that OpenShift is aware of the special MachineConfig requirements, and can 	provision your CNF on a Node that is part of the corresponding MachineConfigSet.  Avoid making changes directly to an 	underlying Node, and let OpenShift handle the heavy lifting of configuring advanced settings.

#### tainted-node-kernel

Property|Description
---|---
Test Case Name|tainted-node-kernel
Test Case Label|platform-alteration-tainted-node-kernel
Unique ID|http://test-network-function.com/testcases/platform-alteration/tainted-node-kernel
Version|v1.0.0
Description|http://test-network-function.com/testcases/platform-alteration/tainted-node-kernel Ensures that the Node(s) hosting CNFs do not utilize tainted kernels. This test case is especially important to support Highly Available CNFs, since when a CNF is re-instantiated on a backup Node, that Node's kernel may not have the same hacks.'
Result Type|normative
Suggested Remediation|Test failure indicates that the underlying Node's kernel is tainted.  Ensure that you have not altered underlying 	Node(s) kernels in order to run the CNF.
