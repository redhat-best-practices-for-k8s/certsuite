# cnf-certification-test catalog

The catalog for cnf-certification-test contains a list of test cases aiming at testing CNF best practices in various areas. Test suites are defined in 10 areas : `platform-alteration`, `access-control`, `affiliated-certification`, `chaostesting`, `lifecycle`, `manageability`,`networking`, `observability`, `operator`, and `performance.`

Depending on the CNF type, not all tests are required to pass to satisfy best practice requirements. The scenario section indicates which tests are mandatory or optional depending on the scenario. The following CNF types / scenarios are defined: `Telco`, `Non-Telco`, `Far-Edge`, `Extended`.

## Test Case list

Test Cases are the specifications used to perform a meaningful test. Test cases may run once, or several times against several targets. CNF Certification includes a number of normative and informative tests to ensure CNFs follow best practices. Here is the list of available Test Cases:

You could use this event to check that a required API is available before the container’s main work begins. Kubernetes will not change the container’s state to Running until the PostStart script has executed successfully. For details, see https://www.containiq.com/post/kubernetes-container-lifecycle-events-and-hooks and https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/containers/container-lifecycle-hooks. PostStart is used to configure container, set up dependencies, record new creation. It can also be used to check that a required API is available before the container’s work begins.

Then, it executes the scale-in oc command for (N-1) replicas. Lastly, it executes the scale-out oc command, restoring the original replicaCount of the crd/s. In case of crd that are managed by HPA the test is changing the min and max value to crd Replica - 1 during scale-in and the original replicaCount again for both min/max during the scale-out stage. Lastly its restoring the original min/max replica of the crd/s

#### platform-alteration-hugepages-config

Property|Description
---|---
Unique ID|platform-alteration-hugepages-config
Description|Checks to see that HugePage settings have been configured through MachineConfig, and not manually on the underlying Node. This test case applies only to Nodes that are configured with the "worker" MachineConfigSet. First, the "worker" MachineConfig is polled, and the Hugepage settings are extracted. Next, the underlying Nodes are polled for configured HugePages through inspection of /proc/meminfo. The results are compared, and the test passes only if they are the same.
Result Type|normative
Suggested Remediation|HugePage settings should be configured either directly through the MachineConfigOperator or indirectly using the PerformanceAddonOperator. This ensures that OpenShift is aware of the special MachineConfig requirements, and can provision your CNF on a Node that is part of the corresponding MachineConfigSet. Avoid making changes directly to an underlying Node, and let OpenShift handle the heavy lifting of configuring advanced settings. This test case applies only to Nodes that are configured with the "worker" MachineConfigSet.
