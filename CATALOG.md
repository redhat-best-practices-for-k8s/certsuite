# test-network-function test case catalog

test-network-function contains a variety of `Test Cases`, as well as `Test Case Building Blocks`.
* Test Cases:  Traditional JUnit testcases, which are specified internally using `Ginkgo.It`.  Test cases often utilize several Test Case Building Blocks.
* Test Case Building Blocks:  Self-contained building blocks, which perform a small task in the context of `oc`, `ssh`, `shell`, or some other `Expecter`.
## Test Case Catalog

Test Cases are the specifications used to perform a meaningful test.  Test cases may run once, or several times against several targets.  CNF Certification includes a number of normative and informative tests to ensure CNFs follow best practices.  Here is the list of available Test Cases:

K8s will handle shutdown of the container using the following: 		1) K8s first execute the preStop hook inside the container. 		2) K8s will wait for a grace period. 		3) K8s will clean the remaining processes using KILL signal.

Description|http://test-network-function.com/testcases/lifecycle/pod-scheduling ensures that CNF Pods do not specify nodeSelector or nodeAffinity.  In most cases, Pods should allow for instantiation on any underlying Node.
Result Type|informative
Suggested Remediation|In most cases, Pod's should not specify their host Nodes through nodeSelector or nodeAffinity.  However, there are cases in which CNFs require specialized hardware specific to a particular class of Node.  As such, this test is purely informative, and will not prevent a CNF from being certified. However, one should have an appropriate justification as to why nodeSelector and/or nodeAffinity is utilized by a CNF.

This test is informative, and will not affect CNF Certification.  In many cases, the default terminationGracePeriod is perfectly acceptable for a CNF.
Result Type|informative
Suggested Remediation|Choose a terminationGracePeriod that is appropriate for your given CNF.  If the default (30s) is appropriate, then feel free to ignore this informative message.  This test is meant to raise awareness around how Pods are terminated, and to suggest that a CNF is configured based on its requirements.  In addition to a terminationGracePeriod, consider utilizing a termination hook in the case that your application requires special shutdown instructions.

Description|http://test-network-function.com/testcases/platform-alteration/base-image ensures that the Container Base Image is not altered post-startup.  This test is a heuristic, and ensures that there are no changes to the following directories: 1) /var/lib/rpm 2) /var/lib/dpkg 3) /bin 4) /sbin 5) /lib 6) /lib64 7) /usr/bin 8) /usr/sbin 9) /usr/lib 10) /usr/lib64
Result Type|normative
Suggested Remediation|Ensure that Container applications do not modify the Container Base Image.  In particular, ensure that the following directories are not modified: 1) /var/lib/rpm 2) /var/lib/dpkg 3) /bin 4) /sbin 5) /lib 6) /lib64 7) /usr/bin 8) /usr/sbin 9) /usr/lib 10) /usr/lib64 Ensure that all required binaries are built directly into the container image, and are not installed post startup.

Property|Description
---|---
Version|v1.0.0
Description|http://test-network-function.com/testcases/platform-alteration/boot-params tests that boot parameters are set through the MachineConfigOperator, and not set manually on the Node.
Result Type|normative
Suggested Remediation|Ensure that boot parameters are set directly through the MachineConfigOperator, or indirectly through the PerformanceAddonOperator.  Boot parameters should not be changed directly through the Node, as OpenShift should manage the changes for you.

### http://test-network-function.com/testcases/platform-alteration/hugepages-config

Property|Description
---|---
Version|v1.0.0
Description|http://test-network-function.com/testcases/platform-alteration/hugepages-config checks to see that HugePage settings have been configured through MachineConfig, and not manually on the underlying Node.  This test case applies only to Nodes that are configured with the "worker" MachineConfigSet.  First, the "worker" MachineConfig is polled, and the Hugepage settings are extracted.  Next, the underlying Nodes are polled for configured HugePages through inspection of /proc/meminfo.  The results are compared, and the test passes only if they are the same.
Result Type|normative
Suggested Remediation|HugePage settings should be configured either directly through the MachineConfigOperator or indirectly using the PerformanceAddonOperator.  This ensures that OpenShift is aware of the special MachineConfig requirements, and can provision your CNF on a Node that is part of the corresponding MachineConfigSet.  Avoid making changes directly to an underlying Node, and let OpenShift handle the heavy lifting of configuring advanced settings.

Result Type|normative
Suggested Remediation|You should recreate the node or change the sysctls, recreating is recommended because there might be other unknown changes

Property|Description
---|---
Version|v1.0.0
Description|http://test-network-function.com/testcases/platform-alteration/tainted-node-kernel ensures that the Node(s) hosting CNFs do not utilize tainted kernels. This test case is especially important to support Highly Available CNFs, since when a CNF is re-instantiated on a backup Node, that Node's kernel may not have the same hacks.'
Result Type|normative
Suggested Remediation|Test failure indicates that the underlying Node's' kernel is tainted.  Ensure that you have not altered underlying Node(s) kernels in order to run the CNF.
