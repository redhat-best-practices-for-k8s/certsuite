# cnf-certification-test catalog

The catalog for cnf-certification-test contains a variety of `Test Cases`, which are traditional JUnit testcases specified internally using `Ginkgo.It`.
## Test Case Catalog

Test Cases are the specifications used to perform a meaningful test.  Test cases may run once, or several times against several targets.  CNF Certification includes a number of normative and informative tests to ensure CNFs follow best practices.  Here is the list of available Test Cases:

### access-control

Description|http://test-network-function.com/testcases/lifecycle/deployment-scaling Tests that CNF deployments support scale in/out operations. 			First, The test starts getting the current replicaCount (N) of the deployment/s with the Pod Under Test. Then, it executes the 			scale-in oc command for (N-1) replicas. Lastly, it executes the scale-out oc command, restoring the original replicaCount of the deployment/s. 		    In case of deployments that are managed by HPA the test is changing the min and max value to deployment Replica - 1 during scale-in and the 			original replicaCount again for both min/max during the scale-out stage. lastly its restoring the original min/max replica of the deployment/s
Result Type|normative
Suggested Remediation|Ensure CNF deployments/replica sets can scale in/out successfully.

Test Case Name|hugepages-config
Test Case Label|platform-alteration-hugepages-config
Unique ID|http://test-network-function.com/testcases/platform-alteration/hugepages-config
Version|v1.0.0
Description|http://test-network-function.com/testcases/platform-alteration/hugepages-config Checks to see that HugePage settings have been configured through MachineConfig, and not manually on the underlying Node.  This test case applies only to Nodes that are configured with the "worker" MachineConfigSet.  First, the "worker" MachineConfig is polled, and the Hugepage settings are extracted.  Next, the underlying Nodes are polled for configured HugePages through inspection of /proc/meminfo.  The results are compared, and the test passes only if they are the same.
Result Type|normative
Suggested Remediation|HugePage settings should be configured either directly through the MachineConfigOperator or indirectly using the 	PerformanceAddonOperator.  This ensures that OpenShift is aware of the special MachineConfig requirements, and can 	provision your CNF on a Node that is part of the corresponding MachineConfigSet.  Avoid making changes directly to an 	underlying Node, and let OpenShift handle the heavy lifting of configuring advanced settings.
