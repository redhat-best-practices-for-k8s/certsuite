# cnf-certification-test catalog

The catalog for cnf-certification-test contains a variety of `Test Cases`, which are traditional JUnit testcases specified internally using `Ginkgo.It`.
## Test Case Catalog

Test Cases are the specifications used to perform a meaningful test.  Test cases may run once, or several times against several targets.  CNF Certification includes a number of normative and informative tests to ensure CNFs follow best practices.  Here is the list of available Test Cases:

K8s will handle shutdown of the container using the following: 		1) K8s first execute the preStop hook inside the container. 		2) K8s will wait for a grace period. 		3) K8s will clean the remaining processes using KILL signal.

Version|v1.0.0
Description|http://test-network-function.com/testcases/lifecycle/pod-scheduling ensures that CNF Pods do not specify nodeSelector or nodeAffinity.  In most cases, Pods should allow for instantiation on any underlying Node.
Result Type|informative
Suggested Remediation|In most cases, Pod's should not specify their host Nodes through nodeSelector or nodeAffinity.  However, there are cases in which CNFs require specialized hardware specific to a particular class of Node.  As such, this test is purely informative, and will not prevent a CNF from being certified. However, one should have an appropriate justification as to why nodeSelector and/or nodeAffinity is utilized by a CNF.

Property|Description

Test Case Name|hugepages-config
Test Case Label|platform-alteration-hugepages-config
Unique ID|http://test-network-function.com/testcases/platform-alteration/hugepages-config
Version|v1.0.0
Description|http://test-network-function.com/testcases/platform-alteration/hugepages-config checks to see that HugePage settings have been configured through MachineConfig, and not manually on the underlying Node.  This test case applies only to Nodes that are configured with the "worker" MachineConfigSet.  First, the "worker" MachineConfig is polled, and the Hugepage settings are extracted.  Next, the underlying Nodes are polled for configured HugePages through inspection of /proc/meminfo.  The results are compared, and the test passes only if they are the same.
Result Type|normative
Suggested Remediation|HugePage settings should be configured either directly through the MachineConfigOperator or indirectly using the PerformanceAddonOperator.  This ensures that OpenShift is aware of the special MachineConfig requirements, and can provision your CNF on a Node that is part of the corresponding MachineConfigSet.  Avoid making changes directly to an underlying Node, and let OpenShift handle the heavy lifting of configuring advanced settings.
