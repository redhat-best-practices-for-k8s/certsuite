## Objective

To provide a set of test cases for the Containerized Network Functions/Cloud Native Functions (CNFs) to verify if best practices

* The **full documentation** is published [here](https://test-network-function.github.io/cnf-certification-test/). Please contact us in case the documentation is broken.

* The catalog of all the available test cases can be found [here](https://github.com/test-network-function/cnf-certification-test/blob/main/CATALOG.md).
