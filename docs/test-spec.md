# Test Specifications

## Available Test Specs

There are two categories for workload tests.

- **General**

These tests are designed to test any commodity workload running on OpenShift, and include specifications such as
`Default` network connectivity.

- **Workload-Specific**

These tests are designed to test some unique aspects of the workload under test are behaving correctly. This could
include specifications such as issuing a `GET` request to a web server, or passing traffic through an IPSEC tunnel.

### General tests

These tests belong to multiple suites that can be run in any combination as is
appropriate for the workload under test.
