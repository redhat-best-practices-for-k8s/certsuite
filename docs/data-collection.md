# Share Test Suite Results with Red Hat

Your test suite results can be collected and stored in our
[Collector](https://github.com/redhat-best-practices-for-k8s/collector) database.

## What information is shared

* Only partner name and pass/fail/skip status per test case is stored

## Why should I store my data in the Collector?
