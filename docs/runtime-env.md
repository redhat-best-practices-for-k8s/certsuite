# Runtime environment variables
To run the test suite, some runtime environment variables are to be set.

## OCP >=4.12 Labels
The following labels need to be added to your default namespace in your cluster
if you are running OCP >=4.12:
```shell
pod-security.kubernetes.io/enforce: privileged
pod-security.kubernetes.io/enforce-version: latest
```

You can manually label the namespace with:
```shell
oc label namespace/default pod-security.kubernetes.io/enforce=privileged
oc label namespace/default pod-security.kubernetes.io/enforce-version=latest
```

## Disable intrusive tests
To skip intrusive tests which may disrupt cluster operations, issue the
following:
```shell
export TNF_NON_INTRUSIVE_ONLY=true
```

Likewise, to enable intrusive tests, set the following:
```shell
export TNF_NON_INTRUSIVE_ONLY=false
```
Intrusive tests are enabled by default.

## Disconnected environment
In a disconnected environment, only specific versions of images are mirrored to
the local repo. For those environments, the partner pod image
`quay.io/testnetworkfunction/cnf-test-partner` and debug pod image
`quay.io/testnetworkfunction/debug-partner` should be mirrored and
`TNF_PARTNER_REPO` should be set to the local repo, e.g.:
```shell
export TNF_PARTNER_REPO=registry.dfwt5g.lab:5000/testnetworkfunction
```

Note that you can also specify the debug pod image to use with `SUPPORT_IMAGE`
environment variable, default to `debug-partner:latest`.
