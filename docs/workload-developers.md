# Workload Guidelines for developers

Developers of Kubernetes workloads, particularly those targeting
[certification with Red Hat on OpenShift](https://redhat-connect.gitbook.io/openshift-badges/badges/cloud-native-network-functions-cnf),
can use this suite to test the interaction of their workload with OpenShift.  If interested in certification
please contact [Red Hat](https://redhat-connect.gitbook.io/red-hat-partner-connect-general-guide/managing-your-account/getting-help/technology-partner-success-desk).

**Requirements**

- [OpenShift 4.10 installation](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.10/welcome/index.html) to run the workload
- At least one extra machine to host the test suite
