## Overview

This package provides functionality related to handling JUnit test results within the CertSuite project.

### Key Features

- Parsing and generating JUnit XML files
- Aggregating test outcomes from multiple sources
- Filtering or transforming test data

### Design Notes

- Assumes standard JUnit XML schema for compatibility with CI tools
- Handles missing fields by providing defaults, which may lead to incomplete reports
- Recommended to use helper functions for creating new test suites rather than manipulating structs directly
