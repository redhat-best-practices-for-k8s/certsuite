# Steps

To test the newly added test / existing tests locally, follow the steps

- Clone the repo
- Set runtime environment variables, as per the requirement.

    For example, to deploy partner deployments in a custom namespace in the test config.

    ```yaml
    targetNameSpaces:
      - name: mynamespace
    ```

- Also, skip intrusive tests

```shell
export TNF_NON_INTRUSIVE_ONLY=true
```

- Set K8s config of the cluster where test pods are running

    ```shell
    export KUBECONFIG=<<mypath/.kube/config>>
    ```

- Execute test suite, which would build and run the suite

    For example, to run `networking` tests

    ```shell
    ./script/development.sh networking
    ```
