With Redis Enterprise, you can:\n* Enjoy high performance and record-setting low latencies with minimal operational overhead\n* Develop highly scalable microservices-based and Kubernetes-orchestrated applications\n* Use versatile data structures for a variety of use cases, such as high-speed transactions, user session management, real-time analytics, caching and many more\n* Leverage enterprise-grade operational controls for high availability, security and seamless scale\n* Automate operational best practices for deploying and managing the Redis Enterprise data platform with built-in Kubernetes Operator support\n* Deploy, manage and move applications to and from any cloud for seamless portability\n\n### Core capabilities\n* **Speed application development and time to market** - Unburden developers from the complexity of infrastructure operations and empower them to manage data with maximum flexibility. This helps them build modern applications quickly, make changes rapidly and support a variety of different data structures, models, relationships and use cases.\n* **Ensure business continuity with always-on data service** - Maintain service uptime and ensure failsafe high availability, instant failover and automatic recovery to protect your applications against unplanned downtime, outages and data loss.\n* **Design for performance and unmatched user experience** - Deliver the highest level of responsiveness and interactive customer experiences with best-in-class exceptional linear scaling high performance through a shared-nothing architecture and in-memory processing.\n* **Simplify operations with automated lifecycle management and layered orchestration** - Automate database provisioning, management and maintenance, and abstract away the complexities of high availability, seamless scale and zero-downtime upgrades with built-in support for Kubernetes and Operators.\n* **Enjoy multi-level robust security** - Provide granular control to meet self-imposed and regulatory compliance regulations and standards with built-in finegrained security controls and data encryption.\n* **Gain platform independence with flexible deployment options** - Ensure portability with multiple deployment options across any cloud of choice for multicloud and hybrid deployments and on-premises.\n* **Ensure success** - Leverage 24x7 enterprise-grade support backed by expertise in managing and scaling hundreds of thousands of Redis databases for thousands of enterprise customers worldwide.\n* **Future proof investments** - Use the most popular database amongst developers, built on open source innovation and entrenched firmly in the application landscape with over 1B downloads on Docker. Redis preserves your investment for years with easy extensibility and versatility through its Modules and support for over 50 different programming languages\n\n#### Prerequisites\nA minimum of 3 nodes which support the following requirements:\n* RAM - At least 3GB with 4GB recommended\n* Persistent Storage - At least 10GB of free space with 20GB recommended.\n* A kubernetes version of 1.9 or higher\n\n#### Recommendations/known issues\n*  Changing the name of the Redis Enterprise Cluster in the spec from the\n  default requires running commands to grant permissions to the pods:\n\n  Operator service account:\n    > *oc adm policy add-scc-to-user redis-enterprise-scc system:serviceaccount:my-project:redis-enterprise-operator*<br>\n\n    Redis Enterprise Cluster service account:\n    > *oc adm policy add-scc-to-user redis-enterprise-scc system:serviceaccount:my-project:<name of Redis Enterprise Cluster>*\n\n    Replace my-project with the actual name of the project/namespace. Replace <name of Redis Enterprise Cluster> with the name of the Redis Enterprise Cluster.\n\n* When creating a Redis Enterprise Cluster without specifying in its spec a `persistentSpec` with explicit `storageClassName`,\nthe default Storage Class of the Kubernetes cluster will be used to dynamically provision storage for the Redis Enterprise Cluster's nodes.\nHowever, if the Kubernetes cluster doesn't have a default Storage Class configured\nand no specific Storage Class was specified in the Redis Enterprise Cluster Spec, the installation of the cluster could fail.\nTo avoid such scenario in cases where a specific Storage Class isn't specified, make sure the Kubernetes Cluster has a default Storage Cluster configured.\nThis can be done by running a `kubectl get storageclass` command and see if one of the Storage Classes' names contains a `(default)` mark.",

Make sure you have a license and to obtain one, please contact Aqua Security at [Contact Us](mailto:cloudsales@aquasec.com).\n2. Create a new project for aqua\n\n    ```oc new-project aqua```\n3. Create the secret for Aqua Database password\n\n    ```oc create secret generic aqua-database-password --from-literal=db-password=<password>```\n    \nPlease note that for the certified operator, the Docker registry secret is NOT needed. For the Red Hat certified operator, the Aqua application images are stored in the Red Hat Connect registry and will be automatically pulled by the Aqua operator.\n\n## Choosing the right channel\n\nChannels are a flexible publishing mechanism that offers you three different Aqua versions to deploy, at any point. These channels map to their respective Aqua versions, describing the maturity based on where they are in their lifecycle:\n* latest: This maps to the Aqua version 4.6.0\n* alpha: This maps to the Aqua version 5.0.0\n* 5.3: This is the latest and greatest version of Aqua (default)\n\n## Deploying the Aqua Operator\n\nAqua Operator follows an easy push button deployment that installs the operator in its own aqua namespace.\nPlease refer to the instructions [here](https://github.com/aquasecurity/aqua-operator/blob/5.3.0/docs/DeployOpenShiftOperator.md).\n\n## Configuring the Aqua Operator\n\nOperators leverage CRDs as a configuration mechanism for the application. Aqua offers a number of CRDs that can be tweaked and configured as per your needs. Please refer to this [link](https://github.com/aquasecurity/aqua-operator/blob/5.3.0/docs/DeployOpenShiftOperator.md#aquacsp-crds) for Custom Resource examples for popular scenarios.\n\n## Support\n\nFor support please contact support@aquasec.com.",

Make sure you have a license and to obtain one, please contact Aqua Security at [Contact Us](mailto:cloudsales@aquasec.com).\n2. Create a new project for aqua\n\n    ```oc new-project aqua```\n\n3. Create the secret for Aqua Database password. If you are using an External Database, make sure you use those credentials.\nNOTE: This step is optional and you can specify the Database password when creating the CRs.\n\n    ```oc create secret generic aqua-database-password --from-literal=db-password=<password> -n aqua```\n\nPlease note that for the certified operator, the Docker registry secret is NOT needed. For the Red Hat certified operator, the Aqua application images are stored in the Red Hat Connect registry and will be automatically pulled by the Aqua operator.\n\n## Choosing the right channel\n\nChannels are a flexible publishing mechanism that offers you three different Aqua versions to deploy, at any point. These channels map to their respective Aqua versions, describing the maturity based on where they are in their lifecycle:\n* 4.6: This maps to the older version of Aqua 4.6.0\n* 5.0: This maps to the Aqua version 5.0.0\n* 5.3: This maps to the Aqua version 5.3.0\n* 6.0: This maps to the Aqua version 6.0.0\n* 6.2: This is the latest and greatest version of Aqua (default)\n\n## Deploying the Aqua Operator\n\nAqua Operator follows an easy push button deployment that installs the operator in its own aqua namespace.\nPlease refer to the instructions [here](https://github.com/aquasecurity/aqua-operator/blob/6.0.0/docs/DeployOpenShiftOperator.md).\n\n## Configuring the Aqua Operator\n\nOperators leverage CRDs as a configuration mechanism for the application. Aqua offers a number of CRDs that can be tweaked and configured as per your needs. Please refer to this [link](https://github.com/aquasecurity/aqua-operator/blob/6.0.0/docs/DeployOpenShiftOperator.md#aquacsp-crds) for Custom Resource examples for popular scenarios.\n\n## Support\n\nFor support please contact support@aquasec.com.",

Make sure you have a license and to obtain one, please contact Aqua Security at [Contact Us](mailto:cloudsales@aquasec.com).\n2. Create a new project for aqua\n\n    ```oc new-project aqua```\n3. Create the secret for Aqua Database password\n\n    ```oc create secret generic aqua-database-password --from-literal=db-password=<password>```\n    \nPlease note that for the certified operator, the Docker registry secret is NOT needed. For the Red Hat certified operator, the Aqua application images are stored in the Red Hat Connect registry and will be automatically pulled by the Aqua operator.\n\n## Choosing the right channel\n\nChannels are a flexible publishing mechanism that offers you three different Aqua versions to deploy, at any point. These channels map to their respective Aqua versions, describing the maturity based on where they are in their lifecycle:\n* latest: This maps to the Aqua version 4.6.0\n* alpha: This maps to the Aqua version 5.0.0\n* 5.3: This is the latest and greatest version of Aqua (default)\n\n## Deploying the Aqua Operator\n\nAqua Operator follows an easy push button deployment that installs the operator in its own aqua namespace.\nPlease refer to the instructions [here](https://github.com/aquasecurity/aqua-operator/blob/5.3.0/docs/DeployOpenShiftOperator.md).\n\n## Configuring the Aqua Operator\n\nOperators leverage CRDs as a configuration mechanism for the application. Aqua offers a number of CRDs that can be tweaked and configured as per your needs. Please refer to this [link](https://github.com/aquasecurity/aqua-operator/blob/5.3.0/docs/DeployOpenShiftOperator.md#aquacsp-crds) for Custom Resource examples for popular scenarios.\n\n## Support\n\nFor support please contact support@aquasec.com.",

Make sure you have a license and to obtain one, please contact Aqua Security at [Contact Us](mailto:cloudsales@aquasec.com).\n2. Create a new project for aqua\n\n    ```oc new-project aqua```\n\n3. Create the secret for Aqua Database password. If you are using an External Database, make sure you use those credentials.\nNOTE: This step is optional and you can specify the Database password when creating the CRs.\n\n    ```oc create secret generic aqua-database-password --from-literal=db-password=<password> -n aqua```\n\nPlease note that for the certified operator, the Docker registry secret is NOT needed. For the Red Hat certified operator, the Aqua application images are stored in the Red Hat Connect registry and will be automatically pulled by the Aqua operator.\n\n## Choosing the right channel\n\nChannels are a flexible publishing mechanism that offers you three different Aqua versions to deploy, at any point. These channels map to their respective Aqua versions, describing the maturity based on where they are in their lifecycle:\n* 4.6: This maps to the older version of Aqua 4.6.0\n* 5.0: This maps to the Aqua version 5.0.0\n* 5.3: This maps to the Aqua version 5.3.0\n* 6.0: This maps to the Aqua version 6.0.0\n* 6.2: This maps to the Aqua version 6.2.0\n* 6.5: This is the latest and greatest version of Aqua (default)\n\n## Deploying the Aqua Operator\n\nAqua Operator follows an easy push button deployment that installs the operator in its own aqua namespace.\nPlease refer to the instructions [here](https://github.com/aquasecurity/aqua-operator/blob/6.2.0/docs/DeployOpenShiftOperator.md).\n\n## Configuring the Aqua Operator\n\nOperators leverage CRDs as a configuration mechanism for the application. Aqua offers a number of CRDs that can be tweaked and configured as per your needs. Please refer to this [link](https://github.com/aquasecurity/aqua-operator/blob/6.2.0/docs/DeployOpenShiftOperator.md#aquacsp-crds) for Custom Resource examples for popular scenarios.\n\n## Support\n\nFor support please contact support@aquasec.com.",

Make sure you have a license and to obtain one, please contact Aqua Security at [Contact Us](mailto:cloudsales@aquasec.com).\n2. Create a new project for aqua\n\n    ```oc new-project aqua```\n\n3. Create the secret for Aqua Database password. If you are using an External Database, make sure you use those credentials.\nNOTE: This step is optional and you can specify the Database password when creating the CRs.\n\n    ```oc create secret generic aqua-database-password --from-literal=db-password=<password> -n aqua```\n\nPlease note that for the certified operator, the Docker registry secret is NOT needed. For the Red Hat certified operator, the Aqua application images are stored in the Red Hat Connect registry and will be automatically pulled by the Aqua operator.\n\n## Choosing the right channel\n\nChannels are a flexible publishing mechanism that offers you three different Aqua versions to deploy, at any point. These channels map to their respective Aqua versions, describing the maturity based on where they are in their lifecycle:\n* 4.6: This maps to the older version of Aqua 4.6.0\n* 5.0: This maps to the Aqua version 5.0.0\n* 5.3: This maps to the Aqua version 5.3.0\n* 6.0: This maps to the Aqua version 6.0.0\n* 6.2: This maps to the Aqua version 6.2.0\n* 6.5: This is the latest and greatest version of Aqua (default)\n\n## Deploying the Aqua Operator\n\nAqua Operator follows an easy push button deployment that installs the operator in its own aqua namespace.\nPlease refer to the instructions [here](https://github.com/aquasecurity/aqua-operator/blob/6.2.0/docs/DeployOpenShiftOperator.md).\n\n## Configuring the Aqua Operator\n\nOperators leverage CRDs as a configuration mechanism for the application. Aqua offers a number of CRDs that can be tweaked and configured as per your needs. Please refer to this [link](https://github.com/aquasecurity/aqua-operator/blob/6.2.0/docs/DeployOpenShiftOperator.md#aquacsp-crds) for Custom Resource examples for popular scenarios.\n\n## Support\n\nFor support please contact support@aquasec.com.",

Make sure you have a license and to obtain one, please contact Aqua Security at [Contact Us](mailto:cloudsales@aquasec.com).\n2. Create a new project for aqua\n\n    ```oc new-project aqua```\n\n3. Create the secret for Aqua Database password. If you are using an External Database, make sure you use those credentials.\nNOTE: This step is optional and you can specify the Database password when creating the CRs.\n\n    ```oc create secret generic aqua-database-password --from-literal=db-password=<password> -n aqua```\n\nPlease note that for the certified operator, the Docker registry secret is NOT needed. For the Red Hat certified operator, the Aqua application images are stored in the Red Hat Connect registry and will be automatically pulled by the Aqua operator.\n\n## Choosing the right channel\n\nChannels are a flexible publishing mechanism that offers you three different Aqua versions to deploy, at any point. These channels map to their respective Aqua versions, describing the maturity based on where they are in their lifecycle:\n* 4.6: This maps to the older version of Aqua 4.6.0\n* 5.0: This maps to the Aqua version 5.0.0\n* 5.3: This maps to the Aqua version 5.3.0\n* 6.0: This maps to the Aqua version 6.0.0\n* 6.2: This maps to the Aqua version 6.2.0\n* 6.5: This is the latest and greatest version of Aqua (default)\n\n## Deploying the Aqua Operator\n\nAqua Operator follows an easy push button deployment that installs the operator in its own aqua namespace.\nPlease refer to the instructions [here](https://github.com/aquasecurity/aqua-operator/blob/6.2.0/docs/DeployOpenShiftOperator.md).\n\n## Configuring the Aqua Operator\n\nOperators leverage CRDs as a configuration mechanism for the application. Aqua offers a number of CRDs that can be tweaked and configured as per your needs. Please refer to this [link](https://github.com/aquasecurity/aqua-operator/blob/6.2.0/docs/DeployOpenShiftOperator.md#aquacsp-crds) for Custom Resource examples for popular scenarios.\n\n## Support\n\nFor support please contact support@aquasec.com.",

Make sure you have a license and to obtain one, please contact Aqua Security at [Contact Us](mailto:cloudsales@aquasec.com).\n2. Create a new project for aqua\n\n    ```oc new-project aqua```\n\n3. Create the secret for Aqua Database password. If you are using an External Database, make sure you use those credentials.\nNOTE: This step is optional and you can specify the Database password when creating the CRs.\n\n    ```oc create secret generic aqua-database-password --from-literal=db-password=<password> -n aqua```\n\nPlease note that for the certified operator, the Docker registry secret is NOT needed. For the Red Hat certified operator, the Aqua application images are stored in the Red Hat Connect registry and will be automatically pulled by the Aqua operator.\n\n## Choosing the right channel\n\nChannels are a flexible publishing mechanism that offers you three different Aqua versions to deploy, at any point. These channels map to their respective Aqua versions, describing the maturity based on where they are in their lifecycle:\n* 4.6: This maps to the older version of Aqua 4.6.0\n* 5.0: This maps to the Aqua version 5.0.0\n* 5.3: This maps to the Aqua version 5.3.0\n* 6.0: This maps to the Aqua version 6.0.0\n* 6.2: This maps to the Aqua version 6.2.0\n* 6.5: This is the latest and greatest version of Aqua (default)\n\n## Deploying the Aqua Operator\n\nAqua Operator follows an easy push button deployment that installs the operator in its own aqua namespace.\nPlease refer to the instructions [here](https://github.com/aquasecurity/aqua-operator/blob/6.2.0/docs/DeployOpenShiftOperator.md).\n\n## Configuring the Aqua Operator\n\nOperators leverage CRDs as a configuration mechanism for the application. Aqua offers a number of CRDs that can be tweaked and configured as per your needs. Please refer to this [link](https://github.com/aquasecurity/aqua-operator/blob/6.2.0/docs/DeployOpenShiftOperator.md#aquacsp-crds) for Custom Resource examples for popular scenarios.\n\n## Support\n\nFor support please contact support@aquasec.com.",

Make sure you have a license and to obtain one, please contact Aqua Security at [Contact Us](mailto:cloudsales@aquasec.com).\n2. Create a new project for aqua\n\n    ```oc new-project aqua```\n\n3. Create the secret for Aqua Database password. If you are using an External Database, make sure you use those credentials.\nNOTE: This step is optional and you can specify the Database password when creating the CRs.\n\n    ```oc create secret generic aqua-database-password --from-literal=db-password=<password> -n aqua```\n\nPlease note that for the certified operator, the Docker registry secret is NOT needed. For the Red Hat certified operator, the Aqua application images are stored in the Red Hat Connect registry and will be automatically pulled by the Aqua operator.\n\n## Choosing the right channel\n\nChannels are a flexible publishing mechanism that offers you three different Aqua versions to deploy, at any point. These channels map to their respective Aqua versions, describing the maturity based on where they are in their lifecycle:\n* 4.6: This maps to the older version of Aqua 4.6.0\n* 5.0: This maps to the Aqua version 5.0.0\n* 5.3: This maps to the Aqua version 5.3.0\n* 6.0: This maps to the Aqua version 6.0.0\n* 6.2: This maps to the Aqua version 6.2.0\n* 6.5: This is the latest and greatest version of Aqua (default)\n\n## Deploying the Aqua Operator\n\nAqua Operator follows an easy push button deployment that installs the operator in its own aqua namespace.\nPlease refer to the instructions [here](https://github.com/aquasecurity/aqua-operator/blob/6.2.0/docs/DeployOpenShiftOperator.md).\n\n## Configuring the Aqua Operator\n\nOperators leverage CRDs as a configuration mechanism for the application. Aqua offers a number of CRDs that can be tweaked and configured as per your needs. Please refer to this [link](https://github.com/aquasecurity/aqua-operator/blob/6.2.0/docs/DeployOpenShiftOperator.md#aquacsp-crds) for Custom Resource examples for popular scenarios.\n\n## Support\n\nFor support please contact support@aquasec.com.",

      "csv_description": "The Intel\u00ae FPGA Programmable Acceleration Card N3000 (Intel\u00ae FPGA PAC N3000) is a highly customizable FPGA SmartNIC which enables high-throughput, low latency and high-bandwith applications.  It allows the optimization of data plane performance to reduce total cost of ownership while maintaining a high degree of flexibility.  The Intel FPGA PAC N3000 plays a key role in accelerating 5G and network functions virtualization (NFV) adoption for ecosystem partners such as telecommunications equipment manufacturers (TEMs) virtual network functions (VNF) vendors, system integrators and telcos, to bring scalable and high-performance solutions to market. The Intel FPGA PAC N3000 includes a variant that is design to be Network Equipment Building System (NEBS)-friendly, and features a Root-of-Trust device that helps protect systems from FPGA host security exploits. This document explains how the FPGA resource can be used on the Smart Edge Open (SEO) platform for accelerating network functions and edge application workloads. We use the Intel\u00ae FPGA PAC N3000 as a reference FPGA PAC and use LTE/5G Forward Error Correction (FEC) as an example workload that accelerates the 5G or 4G L1 base station network function. The same concept and mechanism is applicable for application acceleration workloads like AI and ML on FPGA for Inference applications. The Intel\u00ae FPGA PAC N3000 is a full-duplex, 100 Gbps in-system, re-programmable acceleration card for multi-workload networking application acceleration. It has an optimal memory mixture designed for network functions, with an integrated network interface card (NIC) in a small form factor that enables high throughput, low latency, and low power per bit for a custom networking pipeline. The ACC100 supports the O-RAN adopted DPDK BBDev API - an API which Intel contributed to the opensource community to enable choice and TTM for FEC acceleration solutions. The FlexRAN software reference architecture supports the ACC100 which enables users to quickly evaluate and build platforms for the wide range of vRAN networks. Reduces platform power, E2E latency and Intel\u00ae CPU core count requirements as well as increases cell capacity than existing programmable accelerator. Accelerates both 4G and 5G data concurrently.\tLowers development cost using commercial off the shelf (COTS) servers. Accommodates space-constrained implementations via a low-profile PCIe card form factor. Enables a variety of flexible FlexRAN deployments from small cell to macro to Massive MIMO networks. Supports extended temperature for the most challenging of RAN deployment scenario\u2019s.",

      "csv_description": "The Intel\u00ae FPGA Programmable Acceleration Card N3000 (Intel\u00ae FPGA PAC N3000) is a highly customizable FPGA SmartNIC which enables high-throughput, low latency and high-bandwith applications.  It allows the optimization of data plane performance to reduce total cost of ownership while maintaining a high degree of flexibility.  The Intel FPGA PAC N3000 plays a key role in accelerating 5G and network functions virtualization (NFV) adoption for ecosystem partners such as telecommunications equipment manufacturers (TEMs) virtual network functions (VNF) vendors, system integrators and telcos, to bring scalable and high-performance solutions to market. The Intel FPGA PAC N3000 includes a variant that is design to be Network Equipment Building System (NEBS)-friendly, and features a Root-of-Trust device that helps protect systems from FPGA host security exploits. This document explains how the FPGA resource can be used on the Smart Edge Open (SEO) platform for accelerating network functions and edge application workloads. We use the Intel\u00ae FPGA PAC N3000 as a reference FPGA PAC and use LTE/5G Forward Error Correction (FEC) as an example workload that accelerates the 5G or 4G L1 base station network function. The same concept and mechanism is applicable for application acceleration workloads like AI and ML on FPGA for Inference applications. The Intel\u00ae FPGA PAC N3000 is a full-duplex, 100 Gbps in-system, re-programmable acceleration card for multi-workload networking application acceleration. It has an optimal memory mixture designed for network functions, with an integrated network interface card (NIC) in a small form factor that enables high throughput, low latency, and low power per bit for a custom networking pipeline. The ACC100 supports the O-RAN adopted DPDK BBDev API - an API which Intel contributed to the opensource community to enable choice and TTM for FEC acceleration solutions. The FlexRAN software reference architecture supports the ACC100 which enables users to quickly evaluate and build platforms for the wide range of vRAN networks. Reduces platform power, E2E latency and Intel\u00ae CPU core count requirements as well as increases cell capacity than existing programmable accelerator. Accelerates both 4G and 5G data concurrently.\tLowers development cost using commercial off the shelf (COTS) servers. Accommodates space-constrained implementations via a low-profile PCIe card form factor. Enables a variety of flexible FlexRAN deployments from small cell to macro to Massive MIMO networks. Supports extended temperature for the most challenging of RAN deployment scenario\u2019s.",

      "csv_description": "The Intel\u00ae FPGA Programmable Acceleration Card N3000 (Intel\u00ae FPGA PAC N3000) is a highly customizable FPGA SmartNIC which enables high-throughput, low latency and high-bandwith applications.  It allows the optimization of data plane performance to reduce total cost of ownership while maintaining a high degree of flexibility.  The Intel FPGA PAC N3000 plays a key role in accelerating 5G and network functions virtualization (NFV) adoption for ecosystem partners such as telecommunications equipment manufacturers (TEMs) virtual network functions (VNF) vendors, system integrators and telcos, to bring scalable and high-performance solutions to market. The Intel FPGA PAC N3000 includes a variant that is design to be Network Equipment Building System (NEBS)-friendly, and features a Root-of-Trust device that helps protect systems from FPGA host security exploits. This document explains how the FPGA resource can be used on the Smart Edge Open (SEO) platform for accelerating network functions and edge application workloads. We use the Intel\u00ae FPGA PAC N3000 as a reference FPGA PAC and use LTE/5G Forward Error Correction (FEC) as an example workload that accelerates the 5G or 4G L1 base station network function. The same concept and mechanism is applicable for application acceleration workloads like AI and ML on FPGA for Inference applications. The Intel\u00ae FPGA PAC N3000 is a full-duplex, 100 Gbps in-system, re-programmable acceleration card for multi-workload networking application acceleration. It has an optimal memory mixture designed for network functions, with an integrated network interface card (NIC) in a small form factor that enables high throughput, low latency, and low power per bit for a custom networking pipeline. The ACC100 supports the O-RAN adopted DPDK BBDev API - an API which Intel contributed to the opensource community to enable choice and TTM for FEC acceleration solutions. The FlexRAN software reference architecture supports the ACC100 which enables users to quickly evaluate and build platforms for the wide range of vRAN networks. Reduces platform power, E2E latency and Intel\u00ae CPU core count requirements as well as increases cell capacity than existing programmable accelerator. Accelerates both 4G and 5G data concurrently.\tLowers development cost using commercial off the shelf (COTS) servers. Accommodates space-constrained implementations via a low-profile PCIe card form factor. Enables a variety of flexible FlexRAN deployments from small cell to macro to Massive MIMO networks. Supports extended temperature for the most challenging of RAN deployment scenario\u2019s.",

Within a few moments, you can have a production grade Postgres\ncluster complete with high availability, disaster recovery, and monitoring, all over secure TLS communications.\nEven better, PGO lets you easily customize your Postgres cluster to tailor it to your workload!\n\nWith conveniences like cloning Postgres clusters to using rolling updates to roll out disruptive\nchanges with minimal downtime, PGO is ready to support your Postgres data at every stage of your\nrelease pipeline. Built for resiliency and uptime, PGO will keep your desired Postgres in a desired\nstate so you do not need to worry about it.\n\nPGO is developed with many years of production experience in automating Postgres management on\nKubernetes, providing a seamless cloud native Postgres solution to keep your data always available.\n\n- **PostgreSQL Cluster Provisioning**: [Create, Scale, & Delete PostgreSQL clusters with ease][provisioning],\n  while fully customizing your Pods and PostgreSQL configuration!\n- **High-Availability**: Safe, automated failover backed by a [distributed consensus based high-availability solution][high-availability].\n  Uses [Pod Anti-Affinity][k8s-anti-affinity] to help resiliency; you can configure how aggressive this can be!\n  Failed primaries automatically heal, allowing for faster recovery time. You can even create regularly scheduled\n  backups as well and set your backup retention policy\n- **Disaster Recovery**: [Backups][backups] and [restores][disaster-recovery] leverage the open source [pgBackRest][] utility and\n  [includes support for full, incremental, and differential backups as well as efficient delta restores][backups].\n  Set how long you want your backups retained for. Works great with very large databases!\n- **Monitoring**: [Track the health of your PostgreSQL clusters][monitoring] using the open source [pgMonitor][] library.\n- **Clone**: [Create new clusters from your existing clusters or backups][clone] with efficient data cloning.\n- **TLS**: All connections are over [TLS][tls]. You can also [bring your own TLS infrastructure][tls] if you do not want to use the provided defaults.\n- **Connection Pooling**: Advanced [connection pooling][pool] support using [pgBouncer][].\n- **Affinity and Tolerations**: Have your PostgreSQL clusters deployed to [Kubernetes Nodes][k8s-nodes] of your preference.\n  Set your [pod anti-affinity][k8s-anti-affinity], node affinity, Pod tolerations and more rules to customize your deployment topology!\n- **Full Customizability**: Crunchy PostgreSQL for Kubernetes makes it easy to get your own PostgreSQL-as-a-Service up and running\n  and fully customize your deployments, including:\n    - Choose the resources for your Postgres cluster: [container resources and storage size][resize-cluster].

Replica sets provide redundancy and high\navailability, and are the basis for all production deployments. This section\nintroduces replication in MongoDB as well as the components and architecture\nof replica sets. The section also provides tutorials for common tasks\nrelated to replica sets.\n\n* Sharded Cluster: The set of nodes comprising a sharded MongoDB deployment.\nA sharded cluster consists of config servers, shards, and one or more mongos\nrouting processes. Sharding is a A database architecture that partitions\ndata by key ranges and distributes the data among two or more database\ninstances. Sharding enables horizontal scaling.\n\n## Requirements for deploying MongoDB OpsManager\n\n* In order to deploy resources of type MongoDB OpsManager, you will need to\ncreate a secret containing the [credentials](https://docs.mongodb.com/kubernetes-operator/stable/tutorial/plan-om-resource/#om-rsrc-prereqs)\nfor the Global Onwer user\n\n## Security ##\n\nThe operator can enable TLS for all traffic between servers and also between\nclients and servers. Before enabling `security.tls.enabled` to `true` you\nshould create your certificates.  or you can leave the operator to create all\nthe certificates for you. The operator ability to create certs is been\ndepricted due to Kuberentes API changes.\n\nFor more information, please read the official MongoDB\nKubernetes Operator  [docs](https://docs.mongodb.com/kubernetes-operator/stable/).\n",

The operator ability to create certs is been\ndepricted due to Kuberentes API changes.\n\nFor more information, please read the official MongoDB\nKubernetes Operator  [docs](https://docs.mongodb.com/kubernetes-operator/stable/).\n",

Replica sets provide redundancy and high\navailability, and are the basis for all production deployments. This section\nintroduces replication in MongoDB as well as the components and architecture\nof replica sets. The section also provides tutorials for common tasks\nrelated to replica sets.\n\n* Sharded Cluster: The set of nodes comprising a sharded MongoDB deployment.\nA sharded cluster consists of config servers, shards, and one or more mongos\nrouting processes. Sharding is a A database architecture that partitions\ndata by key ranges and distributes the data among two or more database\ninstances. Sharding enables horizontal scaling.\n\n## Requirements for deploying MongoDB OpsManager\n\n* In order to deploy resources of type MongoDB OpsManager, you will need to\ncreate a secret containing the [credentials](https://docs.mongodb.com/kubernetes-operator/stable/tutorial/plan-om-resource/#om-rsrc-prereqs)\nfor the Global Onwer user\n\n## Security ##\n\nThe operator can enable TLS for all traffic between servers and also between\nclients and servers. Before enabling `security.tls.enabled` to `true` you\nshould create your certificates.  or you can leave the operator to create all\nthe certificates for you. The operator ability to create certs is been\ndepricted due to Kuberentes API changes.\n\nFor more information, please read the official MongoDB\nKubernetes Operator  [docs](https://docs.mongodb.com/kubernetes-operator/stable/).\n",
