Linear scalability and\nproven fault-tolerance on commodity hardware or cloud infrastructure make it the\nperfect platform for mission-critical data. Cassandra's support for replicating\nacross multiple datacenters is best-in-class, providing lower latency for your\nusers and the peace of mind of knowing that you can survive regional outages.\n\n## DataStax Enterprise\n\nThe most advanced distribution of Apache Cassandra\u2122 on the market, with the\nenterprise functionality needed for serious production systems and backed up and\nsupported by the best distributed-experts in the world. It's one platform for\nall types of applications anywhere, any cloud, any model: key-value, graph,\ntabular, JSON.\n\nDataStax Enterprise is a fully integrated and optimized database, with graph,\nanalytics, and search included, all with a unified security model. Simply put,\nit's the only database capable of meeting today's demanding requirements\n\n## Operator Details\n\n`cass-operator` is designed as a modular operator for Apache Cassandra and\nderived  distributions. Apache Cassandra is a distributed database consisting of\nmultiple nodes working in concert to store data and process queries along a\nnumber of fault domains. `cass-operator` has the deployment of a Cassandra\ncluster around the logical domain of a datacenter with the `CassandraDatacenter`\ncustom resource.\n    \nUpon submission of one of these resources it handles provisioning the underlying\nstateful sets (analogous to C\\* logical racks), services, and configuration.\nAdditionally through monitoring pod state via Kubernetes callbacks it handles day to day\noperations such as restarting failed processes, scaling clusters up, and deploying\nconfiguration changes in a rolling, non-disruptive, fashion.\n    \nThis operator is designed to be `Namespace` scoped. A single Kubernetes cluster may\nbe running multiple instances of this operator, in separate namespaces, to support\na number of C\\* clusters and environments. Configuration is simple with the usage of\nYAML based overrides in the Custom Resource paired with an `init` container.\n    \nIn C\\* clusters ordering and timing of certain operations are important to keep the system\nevenly distributed. `cass-operator` takes advantage of a sidecar process within the\nmain container to handle the orchestration of starting our main C* process.",

Linear scalability and\nproven fault-tolerance on commodity hardware or cloud infrastructure make it the\nperfect platform for mission-critical data. Cassandra's support for replicating\nacross multiple datacenters is best-in-class, providing lower latency for your\nusers and the peace of mind of knowing that you can survive regional outages.\n\n## DataStax Enterprise\n\nThe most advanced distribution of Apache Cassandra\u2122 on the market, with the\nenterprise functionality needed for serious production systems and backed up and\nsupported by the best distributed-experts in the world. It's one platform for\nall types of applications anywhere, any cloud, any model: key-value, graph,\ntabular, JSON.\n\nDataStax Enterprise is a fully integrated and optimized database, with graph,\nanalytics, and search included, all with a unified security model. Simply put,\nit's the only database capable of meeting today's demanding requirements\n\n## Operator Details\n\n`cass-operator` is designed as a modular operator for Apache Cassandra and\nderived  distributions. Apache Cassandra is a distributed database consisting of\nmultiple nodes working in concert to store data and process queries along a\nnumber of fault domains. `cass-operator` has the deployment of a Cassandra\ncluster around the logical domain of a datacenter with the `CassandraDatacenter`\ncustom resource.\n    \nUpon submission of one of these resources it handles provisioning the underlying\nstateful sets (analogous to C\\* logical racks), services, and configuration.\nAdditionally through monitoring pod state via Kubernetes callbacks it handles day to day\noperations such as restarting failed processes, scaling clusters up, and deploying\nconfiguration changes in a rolling, non-disruptive, fashion.\n    \nThis operator is designed to be `Namespace` scoped. A single Kubernetes cluster may\nbe running multiple instances of this operator, in separate namespaces, to support\na number of C\\* clusters and environments. Configuration is simple with the usage of\nYAML based overrides in the Custom Resource paired with an `init` container.\n    \nIn C\\* clusters ordering and timing of certain operations are important to keep the system\nevenly distributed. `cass-operator` takes advantage of a sidecar process within the\nmain container to handle the orchestration of starting our main C* process.",

Replica sets provide redundancy and high\navailability, and are the basis for all production deployments. This section\nintroduces replication in MongoDB as well as the components and architecture\nof replica sets. The section also provides tutorials for common tasks\nrelated to replica sets.\n\n* Sharded Cluster: The set of nodes comprising a sharded MongoDB deployment.\nA sharded cluster consists of config servers, shards, and one or more mongos\nrouting processes. Sharding is a A database architecture that partitions\ndata by key ranges and distributes the data among two or more database\ninstances. Sharding enables horizontal scaling.\n\n## Requirements for deploying MongoDB OpsManager\n\n* In order to deploy resources of type MongoDB OpsManager, you will need to\ncreate a secret containing the [credentials](https://docs.mongodb.com/kubernetes-operator/stable/tutorial/plan-om-resource/#om-rsrc-prereqs)\nfor the Global Onwer user\n\n## Security ##\n\nThe operator can enable TLS for all traffic between servers and also between\nclients and servers. Before enabling `security.tls.enabled` to `true` you\nshould create your certificates.  or you can leave the operator to create all\nthe certificates for you. The operator ability to create certs is been\ndepricted due to Kuberentes API changes.\n\nFor more information, please read the official MongoDB\nKubernetes Operator  [docs](https://docs.mongodb.com/kubernetes-operator/stable/).\n",

Linear scalability and\nproven fault-tolerance on commodity hardware or cloud infrastructure make it the\nperfect platform for mission-critical data. Cassandra's support for replicating\nacross multiple datacenters is best-in-class, providing lower latency for your\nusers and the peace of mind of knowing that you can survive regional outages.\n\n## DataStax Enterprise\n\nThe most advanced distribution of Apache Cassandra\u2122 on the market, with the\nenterprise functionality needed for serious production systems and backed up and\nsupported by the best distributed-experts in the world. It's one platform for\nall types of applications anywhere, any cloud, any model: key-value, graph,\ntabular, JSON.\n\nDataStax Enterprise is a fully integrated and optimized database, with graph,\nanalytics, and search included, all with a unified security model. Simply put,\nit's the only database capable of meeting today's demanding requirements\n\n## Operator Details\n\n`cass-operator` is designed as a modular operator for Apache Cassandra and\nderived  distributions. Apache Cassandra is a distributed database consisting of\nmultiple nodes working in concert to store data and process queries along a\nnumber of fault domains. `cass-operator` has the deployment of a Cassandra\ncluster around the logical domain of a datacenter with the `CassandraDatacenter`\ncustom resource.\n    \nUpon submission of one of these resources it handles provisioning the underlying\nstateful sets (analogous to C\\* logical racks), services, and configuration.\nAdditionally through monitoring pod state via Kubernetes callbacks it handles day to day\noperations such as restarting failed processes, scaling clusters up, and deploying\nconfiguration changes in a rolling, non-disruptive, fashion.\n    \nThis operator is designed to be `Namespace` scoped. A single Kubernetes cluster may\nbe running multiple instances of this operator, in separate namespaces, to support\na number of C\\* clusters and environments. Configuration is simple with the usage of\nYAML based overrides in the Custom Resource paired with an `init` container.\n    \nIn C\\* clusters ordering and timing of certain operations are important to keep the system\nevenly distributed. `cass-operator` takes advantage of a sidecar process within the\nmain container to handle the orchestration of starting our main C* process.",

Replica sets provide redundancy and high\navailability, and are the basis for all production deployments. This section\nintroduces replication in MongoDB as well as the components and architecture\nof replica sets. The section also provides tutorials for common tasks\nrelated to replica sets.\n\n* Sharded Cluster: The set of nodes comprising a sharded MongoDB deployment.\nA sharded cluster consists of config servers, shards, and one or more mongos\nrouting processes. Sharding is a A database architecture that partitions\ndata by key ranges and distributes the data among two or more database\ninstances. Sharding enables horizontal scaling.\n\n## Requirements for deploying MongoDB OpsManager\n\n* In order to deploy resources of type MongoDB OpsManager, you will need to\ncreate a secret containing the [credentials](https://docs.mongodb.com/kubernetes-operator/stable/tutorial/plan-om-resource/#om-rsrc-prereqs)\nfor the Global Onwer user\n\n## Security ##\n\nThe operator can enable TLS for all traffic between servers and also between\nclients and servers. Before enabling `security.tls.enabled` to `true` you\nshould create your certificates.  or you can leave the operator to create all\nthe certificates for you. The operator ability to create certs is been\ndepricted due to Kuberentes API changes.\n\nFor more information, please read the official MongoDB\nKubernetes Operator  [docs](https://docs.mongodb.com/kubernetes-operator/stable/).\n",

      "csv_description": "Apache CouchDB lets you access your data where you need it. The [Couch Replication Protocol](http://docs.couchdb.org/en/master/replication/protocol.html) is implemented in a variety of projects and products that span every imaginable computing environment from globally distributed server-clusters, over mobile phones to web browsers.\n\nStore your data safely, on your own servers, or with any leading cloud provider. Your web- and native applications love CouchDB, because it speaks JSON natively and supports binary data for all your data storage needs.\n\nThe [Couch Replication Protocol](http://docs.couchdb.org/en/master/replication/protocol.html) lets your data flow seamlessly between server clusters to mobile phones and web browsers, enabling a compelling [offline-first](http://offlinefirst.org/) user-experience while maintaining high performance and strong reliability. CouchDB comes with a developer-friendly query language, and optionally MapReduce for simple, efficient, and comprehensive data retrieval.\n\n### Operator for Apache CouchDB Features\n* Fully automated deployment and configuration of Apache CouchDB clusters.\n* Support single, multiple, or all namespace install modes.\n\n#### Security\n* TLS - TLS  is supported using Red Hat Service certificates or user-provided certificates.\n* Authentication - The parameter `require_valid_user` defaults to `true`, which means that no requests are allowed from anonymous users. Every request must be authenticated.\n* Authorization - Databases are initially accessible by Apache CouchDB admins only.\n\n#### High Availability\n* Nodes - Each database node in an Apache CouchDB cluster requires its own Kubernetes node. It's recommended that you run it with a minimum of three nodes for any production deployment.\n* Zones - The Apache CouchDB cluster database nodes are spread across available Kubernetes fault zones where available.\n* Replicas - The default configuration for each database is two shards (Q=2) and three shard copies (N=3), where each shard copy is deployed on a separate node in the cluster.\n\n### Reading and writing to Apache CouchDB\n\nThe Operator for Apache CouchDB automatically generates a Service. This can be accessed using port-forwarding e.g. `kubectl port-forward svc/my-couchdb-cluster 443:443 -u admin:mypassword`. Alternatively, configure an OpenShift Route to expose the service externally.\n\n### CouchDB 2.3.1 Update Instructions\nWhen the operator is updated to v2.0 or above any existing CouchDB 2.3.1 cluster will not be automatically upgraded to CouchDB 3. The user must manually trigger this process by removing the version statement `version: 2.3.1` in the CouchDBCluster CR for each CouchDB cluster\nThe operator will then perform a rolling update, with the new pods running CouchDB3.\nIt is advised that customers do this straightaway as CouchDB 2.3.1 is no longer supported.\n\n[Read the complete guide to using the Operator for Apache CouchDB](https://ibm.biz/BdfGQy)\n",

Your web- and native applications love CouchDB, because it speaks JSON natively and supports binary data for all your data storage needs.\n\nThe [Couch Replication Protocol](http://docs.couchdb.org/en/master/replication/protocol.html) lets your data flow seamlessly between server clusters to mobile phones and web browsers, enabling a compelling [offline-first](http://offlinefirst.org/) user-experience while maintaining high performance and strong reliability. CouchDB comes with a developer-friendly query language, and optionally MapReduce for simple, efficient, and comprehensive data retrieval.\n\n### Operator for Apache CouchDB Features\n* Fully automated deployment and configuration of Apache CouchDB clusters.\n* Support single, multiple, or all namespace install modes.\n\n#### Security\n* TLS - TLS  is supported using Red Hat Service certificates or user-provided certificates.\n* Authentication - The parameter `require_valid_user` defaults to `true`, which means that no requests are allowed from anonymous users. Every request must be authenticated.\n* Authorization - Databases are initially accessible by Apache CouchDB admins only.\n\n#### High Availability\n* Nodes - Each database node in an Apache CouchDB cluster requires its own Kubernetes node. It's recommended that you run it with a minimum of three nodes for any production deployment.\n* Zones - The Apache CouchDB cluster database nodes are spread across available Kubernetes fault zones where available.\n* Replicas - The default configuration for each database is two shards (Q=2) and three shard copies (N=3), where each shard copy is deployed on a separate node in the cluster.\n\n### Reading and writing to Apache CouchDB\n\nThe Operator for Apache CouchDB automatically generates a Service. This can be accessed using port-forwarding e.g. `kubectl port-forward svc/my-couchdb-cluster 443:443 -u admin:mypassword`. Alternatively, configure an OpenShift Route to expose the service externally.\n\n### CouchDB 2.3.1 Update Instructions\nWhen the operator is updated to v2.0 or above any existing CouchDB 2.3.1 cluster will not be automatically upgraded to CouchDB 3. The user must manually trigger this process by removing the version statement `version: 2.3.1` in the CouchDBCluster CR for each CouchDB cluster\nThe operator will then perform a rolling update, with the new pods running CouchDB3.\nIt is advised that customers do this straightaway as CouchDB 2.3.1 is no longer supported.\n\n[Read the complete guide to using the Operator for Apache CouchDB](https://ibm.biz/BdfGQy)\n",

      "csv_description": "Apache CouchDB lets you access your data where you need it. The [Couch Replication Protocol](http://docs.couchdb.org/en/master/replication/protocol.html) is implemented in a variety of projects and products that span every imaginable computing environment from globally distributed server-clusters, over mobile phones to web browsers.\n\nStore your data safely, on your own servers, or with any leading cloud provider. Your web- and native applications love CouchDB, because it speaks JSON natively and supports binary data for all your data storage needs.\n\nThe [Couch Replication Protocol](http://docs.couchdb.org/en/master/replication/protocol.html) lets your data flow seamlessly between server clusters to mobile phones and web browsers, enabling a compelling [offline-first](http://offlinefirst.org/) user-experience while maintaining high performance and strong reliability. CouchDB comes with a developer-friendly query language, and optionally MapReduce for simple, efficient, and comprehensive data retrieval.\n\n### Operator for Apache CouchDB Features\n* Fully automated deployment and configuration of Apache CouchDB clusters.\n* Support single, multiple, or all namespace install modes.\n\n#### Security\n* TLS - TLS  is supported using Red Hat Service certificates or user-provided certificates.\n* Authentication - The parameter `require_valid_user` defaults to `true`, which means that no requests are allowed from anonymous users. Every request must be authenticated.\n* Authorization - Databases are initially accessible by Apache CouchDB admins only.\n\n#### High Availability\n* Nodes - Each database node in an Apache CouchDB cluster requires its own Kubernetes node. It's recommended that you run it with a minimum of three nodes for any production deployment.\n* Zones - The Apache CouchDB cluster database nodes are spread across available Kubernetes fault zones where available.\n* Replicas - The default configuration for each database is two shards (Q=2) and three shard copies (N=3), where each shard copy is deployed on a separate node in the cluster.\n\n### Reading and writing to Apache CouchDB\n\nThe Operator for Apache CouchDB automatically generates a Service. This can be accessed using port-forwarding e.g. `kubectl port-forward svc/my-couchdb-cluster 443:443 -u admin:mypassword`. Alternatively, configure an OpenShift Route to expose the service externally.\n\n### CouchDB 2.3.1 Update Instructions\nWhen the operator is updated to v2.0 or above any existing CouchDB 2.3.1 cluster will not be automatically upgraded to CouchDB 3. The user must manually trigger this process by removing the version statement `version: 2.3.1` in the CouchDBCluster CR for each CouchDB cluster\nThe operator will then perform a rolling update, with the new pods running CouchDB3.\nIt is advised that customers do this straightaway as CouchDB 2.3.1 is no longer supported.\n\n[Read the complete guide to using the Operator for Apache CouchDB](https://ibm.biz/BdfGQy)\n",

Linear scalability and\nproven fault-tolerance on commodity hardware or cloud infrastructure make it the\nperfect platform for mission-critical data. Cassandra's support for replicating\nacross multiple datacenters is best-in-class, providing lower latency for your\nusers and the peace of mind of knowing that you can survive regional outages.\n\n## DataStax Enterprise\n\nThe most advanced distribution of Apache Cassandra\u2122 on the market, with the\nenterprise functionality needed for serious production systems and backed up and\nsupported by the best distributed-experts in the world. It's one platform for\nall types of applications anywhere, any cloud, any model: key-value, graph,\ntabular, JSON.\n\nDataStax Enterprise is a fully integrated and optimized database, with graph,\nanalytics, and search included, all with a unified security model. Simply put,\nit's the only database capable of meeting today's demanding requirements\n\n## Operator Details\n\n`cass-operator` is designed as a modular operator for Apache Cassandra and\nderived  distributions. Apache Cassandra is a distributed database consisting of\nmultiple nodes working in concert to store data and process queries along a\nnumber of fault domains. `cass-operator` has the deployment of a Cassandra\ncluster around the logical domain of a datacenter with the `CassandraDatacenter`\ncustom resource.\n    \nUpon submission of one of these resources it handles provisioning the underlying\nstateful sets (analogous to C\\* logical racks), services, and configuration.\nAdditionally through monitoring pod state via Kubernetes callbacks it handles day to day\noperations such as restarting failed processes, scaling clusters up, and deploying\nconfiguration changes in a rolling, non-disruptive, fashion.\n    \nThis operator is designed to be `Namespace` scoped. A single Kubernetes cluster may\nbe running multiple instances of this operator, in separate namespaces, to support\na number of C\\* clusters and environments. Configuration is simple with the usage of\nYAML based overrides in the Custom Resource paired with an `init` container.\n    \nIn C\\* clusters ordering and timing of certain operations are important to keep the system\nevenly distributed. `cass-operator` takes advantage of a sidecar process within the\nmain container to handle the orchestration of starting our main C* process.",

      "csv_description": "Apache CouchDB lets you access your data where you need it. The [Couch Replication Protocol](http://docs.couchdb.org/en/master/replication/protocol.html) is implemented in a variety of projects and products that span every imaginable computing environment from globally distributed server-clusters, over mobile phones to web browsers.\n\nStore your data safely, on your own servers, or with any leading cloud provider. Your web- and native applications love CouchDB, because it speaks JSON natively and supports binary data for all your data storage needs.\n\nThe [Couch Replication Protocol](http://docs.couchdb.org/en/master/replication/protocol.html) lets your data flow seamlessly between server clusters to mobile phones and web browsers, enabling a compelling [offline-first](http://offlinefirst.org/) user-experience while maintaining high performance and strong reliability. CouchDB comes with a developer-friendly query language, and optionally MapReduce for simple, efficient, and comprehensive data retrieval.\n\n### Operator for Apache CouchDB Features\n* Fully automated deployment and configuration of Apache CouchDB clusters.\n* Support single, multiple, or all namespace install modes.\n\n#### Security\n* TLS - TLS  is supported using Red Hat Service certificates or user-provided certificates.\n* Authentication - The parameter `require_valid_user` defaults to `true`, which means that no requests are allowed from anonymous users. Every request must be authenticated.\n* Authorization - Databases are initially accessible by Apache CouchDB admins only.\n\n#### High Availability\n* Nodes - Each database node in an Apache CouchDB cluster requires its own Kubernetes node. It's recommended that you run it with a minimum of three nodes for any production deployment.\n* Zones - The Apache CouchDB cluster database nodes are spread across available Kubernetes fault zones where available.\n* Replicas - The default configuration for each database is two shards (Q=2) and three shard copies (N=3), where each shard copy is deployed on a separate node in the cluster.\n\n### Reading and writing to Apache CouchDB\n\nThe Operator for Apache CouchDB automatically generates a Service. This can be accessed using port-forwarding e.g. `kubectl port-forward svc/my-couchdb-cluster 443:443 -u admin:mypassword`. Alternatively, configure an OpenShift Route to expose the service externally.\n\n### CouchDB 2.3.1 Update Instructions\nWhen the operator is updated to v2.0 or above any existing CouchDB 2.3.1 cluster will not be automatically upgraded to CouchDB 3. The user must manually trigger this process by removing the version statement `version: 2.3.1` in the CouchDBCluster CR for each CouchDB cluster\nThe operator will then perform a rolling update, with the new pods running CouchDB3.\nIt is advised that customers do this straightaway as CouchDB 2.3.1 is no longer supported.\n\n[Read the complete guide to using the Operator for Apache CouchDB](https://ibm.biz/BdfGQy)\n",

The [Couch Replication Protocol](http://docs.couchdb.org/en/master/replication/protocol.html) is implemented in a variety of projects and products that span every imaginable computing environment from globally distributed server-clusters, over mobile phones to web browsers.\n\nStore your data safely, on your own servers, or with any leading cloud provider. Your web- and native applications love CouchDB, because it speaks JSON natively and supports binary data for all your data storage needs.\n\nThe [Couch Replication Protocol](http://docs.couchdb.org/en/master/replication/protocol.html) lets your data flow seamlessly between server clusters to mobile phones and web browsers, enabling a compelling [offline-first](http://offlinefirst.org/) user-experience while maintaining high performance and strong reliability. CouchDB comes with a developer-friendly query language, and optionally MapReduce for simple, efficient, and comprehensive data retrieval.\n\n### Operator for Apache CouchDB Features\n* Fully automated deployment and configuration of Apache CouchDB clusters.\n* Support single, multiple, or all namespace install modes.\n\n#### Security\n* TLS - TLS  is supported using Red Hat Service certificates or user-provided certificates.\n* Authentication - The parameter `require_valid_user` defaults to `true`, which means that no requests are allowed from anonymous users. Every request must be authenticated.\n* Authorization - Databases are initially accessible by Apache CouchDB admins only.\n\n#### High Availability\n* Nodes - Each database node in an Apache CouchDB cluster requires its own Kubernetes node. It's recommended that you run it with a minimum of three nodes for any production deployment.\n* Zones - The Apache CouchDB cluster database nodes are spread across available Kubernetes fault zones where available.\n* Replicas - The default configuration for each database is two shards (Q=2) and three shard copies (N=3), where each shard copy is deployed on a separate node in the cluster.\n\n### Reading and writing to Apache CouchDB\n\nThe Operator for Apache CouchDB automatically generates a Service. This can be accessed using port-forwarding e.g. `kubectl port-forward svc/my-couchdb-cluster 443:443 -u admin:mypassword`. Alternatively, configure an OpenShift Route to expose the service externally.\n\n### CouchDB 2.3.1 Update Instructions\nWhen the operator is updated to v2.0 or above any existing CouchDB 2.3.1 cluster will not be automatically upgraded to CouchDB 3. The user must manually trigger this process by removing the version statement `version: 2.3.1` in the CouchDBCluster CR for each CouchDB cluster\nThe operator will then perform a rolling update, with the new pods running CouchDB3.\nIt is advised that customers do this straightaway as CouchDB 2.3.1 is no longer supported.\n\n[Read the complete guide to using the Operator for Apache CouchDB](https://ibm.biz/BdfGQy)\n",

      "csv_description": "Apache CouchDB lets you access your data where you need it. The [Couch Replication Protocol](http://docs.couchdb.org/en/master/replication/protocol.html) is implemented in a variety of projects and products that span every imaginable computing environment from globally distributed server-clusters, over mobile phones to web browsers.\n\nStore your data safely, on your own servers, or with any leading cloud provider. Your web- and native applications love CouchDB, because it speaks JSON natively and supports binary data for all your data storage needs.\n\nThe [Couch Replication Protocol](http://docs.couchdb.org/en/master/replication/protocol.html) lets your data flow seamlessly between server clusters to mobile phones and web browsers, enabling a compelling [offline-first](http://offlinefirst.org/) user-experience while maintaining high performance and strong reliability. CouchDB comes with a developer-friendly query language, and optionally MapReduce for simple, efficient, and comprehensive data retrieval.\n\n### Operator for Apache CouchDB Features\n* Fully automated deployment and configuration of Apache CouchDB clusters.\n* Support single, multiple, or all namespace install modes.\n\n#### Security\n* TLS - TLS  is supported using Red Hat Service certificates or user-provided certificates.\n* Authentication - The parameter `require_valid_user` defaults to `true`, which means that no requests are allowed from anonymous users. Every request must be authenticated.\n* Authorization - Databases are initially accessible by Apache CouchDB admins only.\n\n#### High Availability\n* Nodes - Each database node in an Apache CouchDB cluster requires its own Kubernetes node. It's recommended that you run it with a minimum of three nodes for any production deployment.\n* Zones - The Apache CouchDB cluster database nodes are spread across available Kubernetes fault zones where available.\n* Replicas - The default configuration for each database is two shards (Q=2) and three shard copies (N=3), where each shard copy is deployed on a separate node in the cluster.\n\n### Reading and writing to Apache CouchDB\n\nThe Operator for Apache CouchDB automatically generates a Service. This can be accessed using port-forwarding e.g. `kubectl port-forward svc/my-couchdb-cluster 443:443 -u admin:mypassword`. Alternatively, configure an OpenShift Route to expose the service externally.\n\n### CouchDB 2.3.1 Update Instructions\nWhen the operator is updated to v2.0 or above any existing CouchDB 2.3.1 cluster will not be automatically upgraded to CouchDB 3. The user must manually trigger this process by removing the version statement `version: 2.3.1` in the CouchDBCluster CR for each CouchDB cluster\nThe operator will then perform a rolling update, with the new pods running CouchDB3.\nIt is advised that customers do this straightaway as CouchDB 2.3.1 is no longer supported.\n\n[Read the complete guide to using the Operator for Apache CouchDB](https://ibm.biz/BdfGQy)\n",

      "csv_description": "# Instana\n\nInstana is an [APM solution](https://www.instana.com/product-overview/) built for microservices that enables IT Ops to build applications faster and deliver higher quality services by automating monitoring, tracing and root cause analysis. The solution is optimized for [Kubernetes](https://www.instana.com/automatic-kubernetes-monitoring/) and [OpenShift](https://www.instana.com/blog/automatic-root-cause-analysis-for-openshift-applications/).\n\n## Instana Agent Operator\n\nThis is the Kubernetes Operator for installing the Instana Agent on Kubernetes or OpenShift.\n\n## Prerequisites for OpenShift\n\nBefore the agent will be able to run in OpenShift, you need to perform a couple of extra configuration steps.\n\nYou need to set up a project for the Instana Agent and configure it's permissions.\n\nThe project you create here needs to be the namespace where you create the Instana Agent custom resource that the operator will use to deploy the agent.\n\nFor example, create the `instana-agent` project:\n\n    oc new-project instana-agent\n\nThen, ensure the `instana-agent` service account is in the privileged security context:\n\n    oc adm policy add-scc-to-user privileged -z instana-agent\n\nThis service account will be created by the operator.\n\nNow you can proceed with installing the operator for the Instana agent.\n\n## Installation and Configuration\n\nFirst, install this operator from [OperatorHub.io](https://operatorhub.io/), [OpenShift Container Platform](https://www.openshift.com/), or [OKD](https://www.okd.io/).\n\nSecond, create a custom resource with the agent configuration in the target namespace (for now, this MUST always be the `instana-agent` namespace). The operator will pick up the custom resource and install the Instana agent accordingly.\n\nThe following is a minimal template of the custom resource:\n\n```yaml\napiVersion: instana.io/v1\nkind: InstanaAgent\nmetadata:\n  name: instana-agent\n  namespace: instana-agent\nspec:\n  zone:\n    name: my-zone # (optional) name of the zone of the host\n  cluster:\n    name: replace-me # replace with the name of your Kubernetes cluster\n  agent:\n    key: replace-me # replace with your Instana agent key\n    endpointHost: ingress-red-saas.instana.io # the monitoring ingress endpoint\n    endpointPort: \"443\" # the monitoring ingress endpoint port, wrapped in quotes\n    env:\n      INSTANA_AGENT_TAGS: example\n    configuration_yaml: |\n      # You can leave this empty, or use this to configure your instana agent.\n      # See https://docs.instana.io/setup_and_manage/host_agent/on/kubernetes/\n```\n\nSave the template in a file `instana-agent.yaml` and edit the following values:\n\n* If your target namespace is not `instana-agent`, replace the `namespace:` accordingly.\n* `agent.key` must be set with your Instana agent key.\n* `agent.endpointHost` must be set with the monitoring ingress endpoint, generally either `saas-us-west-2.instana.io` or `saas-eu-west-1.instana.io`.\n* `agent.endpointPort` must be set with the monitoring ingress port, generally \"443\" (wrapped in quotes).\n* `zone.name` should be set with the name of the Kubernetes cluster that is be displayed in Instana.\n\nFor advanced configuration, you can edit the contents of the `configuration.yaml` file. View documentation [here](https://docs.instana.io/setup_and_manage/host_agent/on/kubernetes/).\n\nApply the custom resource with `kubectl apply -f instana-agent.yaml`. After some time, you should see `instana-agent` Pods being created on each node of your cluster, and your cluster should show on the infrastructure map on your Instana Web interface.\n\n## Uninstalling\n\nIn order to uninstall the Instana agent, simply remove the custom resource with `kubectl delete -f instana-agent.yaml`.\n\n## Source Code\n\nThe Instana agent operator is an open source project hosted on [https://github.com/instana/instana-agent-operator](https://github.com/instana/instana-agent-operator/).\n",

Pachyderm provides industry leading data versioning, pipelines and lineage that allow data science teams to automate the machine learning lifecycle and optimize their machine learning operations (MLOps). \n\n## Getting started\n\n1. Pachyderm uses an object store to store your data. Set the pachd storage backend at `pachyderm.spec.pachd.storage.backend` to `AMAZON`, `MICROSOFT`, `GOOGLE` or `MINIO` depending on your storage provider. Additionally, create a user with read/write access to the object store.\n\n2. Setup the user credentials in the section, `pachyderm.spec.pachd.storage`. Required fields depend on the backend type set in step 1 above.\n\n3. Finally, deploy the pachyderm cluster in its own namespace.\n\nFor more information on getting started, reference the documentation.\n",

Pachyderm provides industry leading data versioning, pipelines and lineage that allow data science teams to automate the machine learning lifecycle and optimize their machine learning operations (MLOps). \n\n## Getting started\n\n1. Pachyderm uses an object store to store your data. Set the pachd storage backend at `pachyderm.spec.pachd.storage.backend` to `AMAZON`, `MICROSOFT`, `GOOGLE` or `MINIO` depending on your storage provider. Additionally, create a user with read/write access to the object store.\n\n2. Setup the user credentials in the section, `pachyderm.spec.pachd.storage`. Required fields depend on the backend type set in step 1 above.\n\n3. Finally, deploy the pachyderm cluster in its own namespace.\n\nFor more information on getting started, reference the documentation.\n",

      "csv_description": "# Instana\n\nInstana is an [APM solution](https://www.instana.com/product-overview/) built for microservices that enables IT Ops to build applications faster and deliver higher quality services by automating monitoring, tracing and root cause analysis. The solution is optimized for [Kubernetes](https://www.instana.com/automatic-kubernetes-monitoring/) and [OpenShift](https://www.instana.com/blog/automatic-root-cause-analysis-for-openshift-applications/).\n\n## Instana Agent Operator\n\nThis is the Kubernetes Operator for installing the Instana Agent on Kubernetes or OpenShift.\n\n## Prerequisites for OpenShift\n\nBefore the agent will be able to run in OpenShift, you need to perform a couple of extra configuration steps.\n\nYou need to set up a project for the Instana Agent and configure it's permissions.\n\nThe project you create here needs to be the namespace where you create the Instana Agent custom resource that the operator will use to deploy the agent.\n\nFor example, create the `instana-agent` project:\n\n    oc new-project instana-agent\n\nThen, ensure the `instana-agent` service account is in the privileged security context:\n\n    oc adm policy add-scc-to-user privileged -z instana-agent\n\nThis service account will be created by the operator.\n\nNow you can proceed with installing the operator for the Instana agent.\n\n## Installation and Configuration\n\nFirst, install this operator from [OperatorHub.io](https://operatorhub.io/), [OpenShift Container Platform](https://www.openshift.com/), or [OKD](https://www.okd.io/).\n\nSecond, create a custom resource with the agent configuration in the target namespace (for now, this MUST always be the `instana-agent` namespace). The operator will pick up the custom resource and install the Instana agent accordingly.\n\nThe following is a minimal template of the custom resource:\n\n```yaml\napiVersion: instana.io/v1\nkind: InstanaAgent\nmetadata:\n  name: instana-agent\n  namespace: instana-agent\nspec:\n  zone:\n    name: my-zone # (optional) name of the zone of the host\n  cluster:\n    name: replace-me # replace with the name of your Kubernetes cluster\n  agent:\n    key: replace-me # replace with your Instana agent key\n    endpointHost: ingress-red-saas.instana.io # the monitoring ingress endpoint\n    endpointPort: \"443\" # the monitoring ingress endpoint port, wrapped in quotes\n    env:\n      INSTANA_AGENT_TAGS: example\n    configuration_yaml: |\n      # You can leave this empty, or use this to configure your instana agent.\n      # See https://docs.instana.io/setup_and_manage/host_agent/on/kubernetes/\n```\n\nSave the template in a file `instana-agent.yaml` and edit the following values:\n\n* If your target namespace is not `instana-agent`, replace the `namespace:` accordingly.\n* `agent.key` must be set with your Instana agent key.\n* `agent.endpointHost` must be set with the monitoring ingress endpoint, generally either `saas-us-west-2.instana.io` or `saas-eu-west-1.instana.io`.\n* `agent.endpointPort` must be set with the monitoring ingress port, generally \"443\" (wrapped in quotes).\n* `zone.name` should be set with the name of the Kubernetes cluster that is be displayed in Instana.\n\nFor advanced configuration, you can edit the contents of the `configuration.yaml` file. View documentation [here](https://docs.instana.io/setup_and_manage/host_agent/on/kubernetes/).\n\nApply the custom resource with `kubectl apply -f instana-agent.yaml`. After some time, you should see `instana-agent` Pods being created on each node of your cluster, and your cluster should show on the infrastructure map on your Instana Web interface.\n\n## Uninstalling\n\nIn order to uninstall the Instana agent, simply remove the custom resource with `kubectl delete -f instana-agent.yaml`.\n\n## Source Code\n\nThe Instana agent operator is an open source project hosted on [https://github.com/instana/instana-agent-operator](https://github.com/instana/instana-agent-operator/).\n",

Pachyderm provides industry leading data versioning, pipelines and lineage that allow data science teams to automate the machine learning lifecycle and optimize their machine learning operations (MLOps). \n\n## Getting started\n\n1. Pachyderm uses an object store to store your data. Set the pachd storage backend at `pachyderm.spec.pachd.storage.backend` to `AMAZON`, `MICROSOFT`, `GOOGLE` or `MINIO` depending on your storage provider. Additionally, create a user with read/write access to the object store.\n\n2. Setup the user credentials in the section, `pachyderm.spec.pachd.storage`. Required fields depend on the backend type set in step 1 above.\n\n3. Finally, deploy the pachyderm cluster in its own namespace.\n\nFor more information on getting started, reference the documentation.\n",

MANTA performs code scanning for lineage that is illustrated to the detailed attribute level with transformations.   Extreme color coding and filtering to make lineage consumable.  Also includes time-slicing for historical lineage analysis.\n\n## Features\n* **Create/Destroy**: Launch MANTA Flow Container deployment.\n* **Scaling to zero**: Scale down the deployment (turn off the container).\n\n## Prerequisites and Requirements\n### MANTA Flow Namespace\nMANTA should be installed into its own namespace.\n\nFor additional installation documentation see a [MANTA Flow Container documentation](https://mantatools.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/MTKB/pages/2450620467/MANTA+Flow+Container)\nin the MANTA Flow Knowledge Base.\n\n### MANTA Flow Operator\nThe MANTA Flow Operator is responsible for deployment and management of MANTA Flow container deployment.\n\n### Memory Considerations\nMANTA Flow is a memory intensive application. The MANTA Flow Container will specify the memory and cpu requirements for both request and limits. Also, the minimum storage requirements are specified for the persistent volumes (PVs).\n\n### MANTA Flow license.key\nValid license.key needs to be provided in order to successfully launch MANTA Flow Container.\n\n## MANTA Flow Deployment\n\n### Secrets\nCreate a secret for MANTA Flow license.key by:\n    \n    oc create secret generic mantaflow-keys --from-file=<path to license.key>/license.key\n\nCreate an initial admin credentials `username` and `password` and a MANTA master password, which is used for encryption of sensitive data in the persistent storage.\n\n    oc create secret generic mantaflow-credentials --from-literal=username=<manta admin username> --from-literal=password=<manta admin password> --from-literal=MANTA_MASTERPASSWORD=<password for encryption>\n\n### Create MANTA Auth Custom Resource\nCreate a MANTA Auth custom resource.

Within a few moments, you can have a production grade Postgres\ncluster complete with high availability, disaster recovery, and monitoring, all over secure TLS communications.\nEven better, PGO lets you easily customize your Postgres cluster to tailor it to your workload!\n\nWith conveniences like cloning Postgres clusters to using rolling updates to roll out disruptive\nchanges with minimal downtime, PGO is ready to support your Postgres data at every stage of your\nrelease pipeline. Built for resiliency and uptime, PGO will keep your desired Postgres in a desired\nstate so you do not need to worry about it.\n\nPGO is developed with many years of production experience in automating Postgres management on\nKubernetes, providing a seamless cloud native Postgres solution to keep your data always available.\n\n- **PostgreSQL Cluster Provisioning**: [Create, Scale, & Delete PostgreSQL clusters with ease][provisioning],\n  while fully customizing your Pods and PostgreSQL configuration!\n- **High-Availability**: Safe, automated failover backed by a [distributed consensus based high-availability solution][high-availability].\n  Uses [Pod Anti-Affinity][k8s-anti-affinity] to help resiliency; you can configure how aggressive this can be!\n  Failed primaries automatically heal, allowing for faster recovery time. You can even create regularly scheduled\n  backups as well and set your backup retention policy\n- **Disaster Recovery**: [Backups][backups] and [restores][disaster-recovery] leverage the open source [pgBackRest][] utility and\n  [includes support for full, incremental, and differential backups as well as efficient delta restores][backups].\n  Set how long you want your backups retained for. Works great with very large databases!\n- **Monitoring**: [Track the health of your PostgreSQL clusters][monitoring] using the open source [pgMonitor][] library.\n- **Clone**: [Create new clusters from your existing clusters or backups][clone] with efficient data cloning.\n- **TLS**: All connections are over [TLS][tls]. You can also [bring your own TLS infrastructure][tls] if you do not want to use the provided defaults.\n- **Connection Pooling**: Advanced [connection pooling][pool] support using [pgBouncer][].\n- **Affinity and Tolerations**: Have your PostgreSQL clusters deployed to [Kubernetes Nodes][k8s-nodes] of your preference.\n  Set your [pod anti-affinity][k8s-anti-affinity], node affinity, Pod tolerations and more rules to customize your deployment topology!\n- **Full Customizability**: Crunchy PostgreSQL for Kubernetes makes it easy to get your own PostgreSQL-as-a-Service up and running\n  and fully customize your deployments, including:\n    - Choose the resources for your Postgres cluster: [container resources and storage size][resize-cluster]. [Resize at any time][resize-cluster] with minimal disruption.\n    - Use your own container image repository, including support `imagePullSecrets` and private repositories\n    - [Customize your PostgreSQL configuration][customize-cluster]\n\nand much more!\n\n[backups]: https://access.crunchydata.com/documentation/postgres-operator/v5/tutorial/backups/\n[clone]: https://access.crunchydata.com/documentation/postgres-operator/v5/tutorial/disaster-recovery/#clone-a-postgres-cluster\n[customize-cluster]: https://access.crunchydata.com/documentation/postgres-operator/v5/tutorial/customize-cluster/\n[disaster-recovery]: https://access.crunchydata.com/documentation/postgres-operator/v5/tutorial/disaster-recovery/\n[high-availability]: https://access.crunchydata.com/documentation/postgres-operator/v5/tutorial/high-availability/\n[monitoring]: https://access.crunchydata.com/documentation/postgres-operator/v5/tutorial/monitoring/\n[pool]: https://access.crunchydata.com/documentation/postgres-operator/v5/tutorial/connection-pooling/\n[provisioning]: https://access.crunchydata.com/documentation/postgres-operator/v5/tutorial/create-cluster/\n[resize-cluster]: https://access.crunchydata.com/documentation/postgres-operator/v5/tutorial/resize-cluster/\n[tls]: https://access.crunchydata.com/documentation/postgres-operator/v5/tutorial/customize-cluster/#customize-tls\n\n[k8s-anti-affinity]: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/assign-pod-node/#inter-pod-affinity-and-anti-affinity\n[k8s-nodes]: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/architecture/nodes/\n\n[pgBackRest]: https://www.pgbackrest.org\n[pgBouncer]: https://access.crunchydata.com/documentation/postgres-operator/v5/tutorial/connection-pooling/\n[pgMonitor]: https://github.com/CrunchyData/pgmonitor\n\n\n## Post-Installation\n\n### Tutorial\n\nWant to [learn more about the PostgreSQL Operator][tutorial]?

      "csv_description": "The Dynatrace Operator supports rollout and lifecycle management of various Dynatrace components in Kubernetes and OpenShift.\n\nCurrently the Dynatrace Operator supports the following capabilities:\n\n### OneAgent\n  * `classicFullStack` rolls out one OneAgent pod per node to monitor its pods and the node itself\n  * `applicationMonitoring` is a webhook based injection mechanism for automatic app-only injection\n  * `hostMonitoring` monitors only the hosts, i.e., the nodes, in the cluster without app-only injection\n### ActiveGate\n  * `routing` routes OneAgent traffic through the ActiveGate\n  * `kubernetes-monitoring` allows monitoring the Kubernetes API\n  * `metrics-ingest` routes enriched metrics through an ActiveGate\n\nFor more information please refer to [our DynaKube Custom Resource examples](https://dt-url.net/dynakube-samples).\n\n### Installation\nOnce you've installed the Dynatrace Operator, you can create a DynaKube custom resource.\n\nFirst, please add a Secret within the Project you've deployed the Dynatrace Operator to, which would contain your API and PaaS tokens. Create tokens of type *Dynatrace API* (`API_TOKEN`) and *Platform as a Service* (`PAAS_TOKEN`) and use their values in the following commands respectively.\n\nFor assistance please refer to [Create user-generated access tokens](https://www.dynatrace.com/support/help/shortlink/token#create-user-generated-access-tokens).\n\n``` $ oc -n <project> create secret generic dynakube --from-literal=\"apiToken=API_TOKEN\" --from-literal=\"paasToken=PAAS_TOKEN\" ```\n\nYou may update this Secret at any time to rotate the tokens.\n\nAfter creation of the secret add the DynaKube object in the project where the Dynatrace Operator has been deployed, configured to your needs.\n\n### Required Parameters\n* `apiUrl` - provide the URL to the API of your Dynatrace environment. In Dynatrace SaaS it will look like `https://<ENVIRONMENTID>.live.dynatrace.com/api` . In Dynatrace Managed like `https://<YourDynatraceServerURL>/e/<ENVIRONMENTID>/api` .\n\n### Advanced Options\n* **Disable Certificate Checking** - disable any certificate validation that may interact poorly with proxies with in your cluster\n* **Image Override** - use a copy of the ActiveGate container image from a registry other than Docker's or Red Hat's\n\nFor a complete list of supported parameters please consult the [Operator Deploy Guide](https://www.dynatrace.com/support/help/shortlink/openshift-deploy).\n\n### Help\nYou can find more about our instructions in our [documentation](https://www.dynatrace.com/support/help/shortlink/openshift-deploy#install-dynatrace-operator).\n",
