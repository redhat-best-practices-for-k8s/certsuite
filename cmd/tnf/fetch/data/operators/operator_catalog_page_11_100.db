      "csv_description": "Crunchy PostgreSQL for OpenShift lets you run your own production-grade PostgreSQL-as-a-Service on OpenShift!\n\nPowered by the Crunchy [PostgreSQL Operator](https://github.com/CrunchyData/postgres-operator), Crunchy PostgreSQL\nfor OpenShift automates and simplifies deploying and managing open source PostgreSQL clusters on OpenShift by\nproviding the essential features you need to keep your PostgreSQL clusters up and running, including:\n\n- **PostgreSQL Cluster Provisioning**: [Create, Scale, & Delete PostgreSQL clusters with ease][provisioning],\n  while fully customizing your Pods and PostgreSQL configuration!\n- **High-Availability**: Safe, automated failover backed by a [distributed consensus based high-availability solution][high-availability].\n  Uses [Pod Anti-Affinity][k8s-anti-affinity] to help resiliency; you can configure how aggressive this can be!\n  Failed primaries automatically heal, allowing for faster recovery time. You can even create regularly scheduled\n  backups as well and set your backup retention policy\n- **Disaster Recovery**: Backups and restores leverage the open source [pgBackRest][] utility\n  and [includes support for full, incremental, and differential backups as well as efficient delta restores][disaster-recovery].\n  Set how long you want your backups retained for. Works great with very large databases!\n- **Monitoring**: Track the health of your PostgreSQL clusters using the open source [pgMonitor][] library.\n- **Clone**: Create new clusters from your existing clusters or backups with a single [`pgo create cluster --restore-from`][pgo-create-cluster] command.\n- **TLS**: Secure communication between your applications and data servers by [enabling TLS for your PostgreSQL servers][pgo-task-tls], including the ability to enforce that all of your connections to use TLS.\n- **Connection Pooling**: Use [pgBouncer][] for connection pooling\n- **Affinity and Tolerations**: Have your PostgreSQL clusters deployed to [Kubernetes Nodes][k8s-nodes] of your preference with [node affinity][high-availability-node-affinity], or designate which nodes Kubernetes can schedule PostgreSQL instances to with Kubernetes [tolerations][high-availability-tolerations].\n- **Full Customizability**: Crunchy PostgreSQL for OpenShift makes it easy to get your own PostgreSQL-as-a-Service up and running on\n  and lets make further enhancements to customize your deployments, including:\n    - Selecting different storage classes for your primary, replica, and backup storage\n    - Select your own container resources class for each PostgreSQL cluster deployment; differentiate between resources applied for primary and replica clusters!\n    - Use your own container image repository, including support `imagePullSecrets` and private repositories\n    - Bring your own trusted certificate authority (CA) for use with the Operator API server\n    - Override your PostgreSQL configuration for each cluster\n\nand much more!\n\n[disaster-recovery]: https://access.crunchydata.com/documentation/postgres-operator/latest/architecture/disaster-recovery/\n[high-availability]: https://access.crunchydata.com/documentation/postgres-operator/latest/architecture/high-availability/\n[high-availability-node-affinity]: https://access.crunchydata.com/documentation/postgres-operator/latest/architecture/high-availability/#node-affinity\n[high-availability-tolerations]: https://access.crunchydata.com/documentation/postgres-operator/latest/architecture/high-availability/#tolerations\n[pgo-create-cluster]: https://access.crunchydata.com/documentation/postgres-operator/latest/pgo-client/reference/pgo_create_cluster/\n[pgo-task-tls]: https://access.crunchydata.com/documentation/postgres-operator/latest/tutorial/tls/\n[provisioning]: https://access.crunchydata.com/documentation/postgres-operator/latest/architecture/provisioning/\n\n[k8s-anti-affinity]: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/assign-pod-node/#inter-pod-affinity-and-anti-affinity\n[k8s-nodes]: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/architecture/nodes/\n\n[pgBackRest]: https://www.pgbackrest.org\n[pgBouncer]: https://access.crunchydata.com/documentation/postgres-operator/latest/tutorial/pgbouncer/\n[pgMonitor]: https://github.com/CrunchyData/pgmonitor\n\n## Pre-Installation\n\nThere are a few manual steps that the cluster administrator must perform prior to installing the PostgreSQL Operator.\nAt the very least, it must be provided with an initial configuration.\n\nFirst, select a namespace in which to install the PostgreSQL Operator. PostgreSQL clusters will also be deployed here.\nIf it does not exist, create it now.\n\n```\nexport PGO_OPERATOR_NAMESPACE=pgo\noc create namespace \"$PGO_OPERATOR_NAMESPACE\"\n```\n\n### Security\n\nFor the PostgreSQL Operator and PostgreSQL clusters to run in the recommended `restricted` [Security Context Constraint][],\nedit `conf/postgres-operator/pgo.yaml` and set `DisableFSGroup` to `true`.\n\n[Security Context Constraint]: https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/latest/authentication/managing-security-context-constraints.html\n\n### Secrets (optional)\n\nIf you plan to use AWS S3 to store backups, you can configure your environment to automatically provide your AWS S3 credentials to all newly created PostgreSQL clusters:\n\n```\noc -n \"$PGO_OPERATOR_NAMESPACE\" create secret generic pgo-backrest-repo-config \\\n  --from-literal=aws-s3-key=\"<your-aws-s3-key>\" \\\n  --from-literal=aws-s3-key-secret=\"<your-aws-s3-key-secret>\"\n```\n\n### Certificates (optional)\n\nThe PostgreSQL Operator has an API that uses TLS to communicate securely with clients.

There are several\nthat a PostgreSQL cluster requires to be deployed, including:\n\n- Secrets\n  - Information for setting up a pgBackRest repository\n  - PostgreSQL superuser bootstrap credentials\n  - PostgreSQL replication user bootstrap credentials\n  - PostgresQL standard user bootstrap credentials\n\nAdditionally, if you want to add some of the other sidecars, you may need to\ncreate additional secrets.\n\nThe good news is that if you do not provide these objects, the PostgreSQL\nOperator will create them for you to get your Postgres cluster up and running!\n\nThe following goes through how to create a PostgreSQL cluster called\n`hippo` by creating a new custom resource.\n\n```\n# this variable is the name of the cluster being created\nexport pgo_cluster_name=hippo\n# this variable is the namespace the cluster is being deployed into\nexport cluster_namespace=pgo\n# this variable is set to the location of your image repository\nexport cluster_image_prefix=registry.developers.crunchydata.com/crunchydata\n\ncat <<-EOF > \"${pgo_cluster_name}-pgcluster.yaml\"\napiVersion: crunchydata.com/v1\nkind: Pgcluster\nmetadata:\n  annotations:\n    current-primary: ${pgo_cluster_name}\n  labels:\n    crunchy-pgha-scope: ${pgo_cluster_name}\n    deployment-name: ${pgo_cluster_name}\n    name: ${pgo_cluster_name}\n    pg-cluster: ${pgo_cluster_name}\n    pgo-version: 4.6.2\n    pgouser: admin\n  name: ${pgo_cluster_name}\n  namespace: ${cluster_namespace}\nspec:\n  BackrestStorage:\n    accessmode: ReadWriteMany\n    matchLabels: \"\"\n    name: \"\"\n    size: 1G\n    storageclass: \"\"\n    storagetype: create\n    supplementalgroups: \"\"\n  PrimaryStorage:\n    accessmode: ReadWriteMany\n    matchLabels: \"\"\n    name: ${pgo_cluster_name}\n    size: 1G\n    storageclass: \"\"\n    storagetype: create\n    supplementalgroups: \"\"\n  ReplicaStorage:\n    accessmode: ReadWriteMany\n    matchLabels: \"\"\n    name: \"\"\n    size: 1G\n    storageclass: \"\"\n    storagetype: create\n    supplementalgroups: \"\"\n  annotations: {}\n  ccpimage: crunchy-postgres-ha\n  ccpimageprefix: ${cluster_image_prefix}\n  ccpimagetag: centos8-13.2-4.6.2\n  clustername: ${pgo_cluster_name}\n  database: ${pgo_cluster_name}\n  exporterport: \"9187\"\n  limits: {}\n  name: ${pgo_cluster_name}\n  namespace: ${cluster_namespace}\n  pgDataSource:\n    restoreFrom: \"\"\n    restoreOpts: \"\"\n  pgbadgerport: \"10000\"\n  pgoimageprefix: ${cluster_image_prefix}\n  podAntiAffinity:\n    default: preferred\n    pgBackRest: preferred\n    pgBouncer: preferred\n  port: \"5432\"\n  tolerations: []\n  user: hippo\n  userlabels:\n    pgo-version: 4.6.2\nEOF\n\noc apply -f \"${pgo_cluster_name}-pgcluster.yaml\"\n```\n\nAnd that's all! The PostgreSQL Operator will go ahead and create the cluster.\n\nIf you have the PostgreSQL client `psql` installed on your host machine, you can\ntest connection to the PostgreSQL cluster using the following command:\n\n```\n# namespace that the cluster is running in\nexport PGO_OPERATOR_NAMESPACE=pgo\n# name of the cluster\nexport pgo_cluster_name=hippo\n# name of the user whose password we want to get\nexport pgo_cluster_username=hippo\n\n# get the password of the user and set it to a recognized psql environmental variable\nexport PGPASSWORD=$(oc -n \"${PGO_OPERATOR_NAMESPACE}\" get secrets \\\n  \"${pgo_cluster_name}-${pgo_cluster_username}-secret\" -o \"jsonpath={.data['password']}\" | base64 -d)\n\n# set up a port-forward either in a new terminal, or in the same terminal in the background:\noc -n pgo port-forward svc/hippo 5432:5432 &\n\npsql -h localhost -U \"${pgo_cluster_username}\" \"${pgo_cluster_name}\"\n```\n\n### Create a PostgreSQL Cluster the `pgo` Client\n\nOnce the PostgreSQL Operator is installed in your OpenShift cluster, you will need to do a few things\nto use the [PostgreSQL Operator Client][pgo-client].\n\n[pgo-client]: https://access.crunchydata.com/documentation/postgres-operator/latest/pgo-client/\n\nInstall the first set of client credentials and download the `pgo` binary and client certificates.\n\n```\ncurl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CrunchyData/postgres-operator/v4.6.2/deploy/install-bootstrap-creds.sh > install-bootstrap-creds.sh\ncurl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CrunchyData/postgres-operator/v4.6.2/installers/kubectl/client-setup.sh > client-setup.sh\n\nchmod +x install-bootstrap-creds.sh client-setup.sh\n\nPGO_CMD=oc ./install-bootstrap-creds.sh\nPGO_CMD=oc ./client-setup.sh\n```\n\nThe client needs to be able to reach the PostgreSQL Operator API from outside the OpenShift cluster.\nCreate an external service or forward a port locally.\n\n```\noc -n \"$PGO_OPERATOR_NAMESPACE\" expose deployment postgres-operator\noc -n \"$PGO_OPERATOR_NAMESPACE\" create route passthrough postgres-operator --service=postgres-operator\n\nexport PGO_APISERVER_URL=\"https://$(oc -n \"$PGO_OPERATOR_NAMESPACE\" get route postgres-operator -o jsonpath=\"{.spec.host}\")\"\n```\n_or_\n```\noc -n \"$PGO_OPERATOR_NAMESPACE\" port-forward deployment/postgres-operator 8443\n\nexport PGO_APISERVER_URL=\"https://127.0.0.1:8443\"\n```\n\nVerify connectivity using the `pgo` command.\n\n```\npgo version\n# pgo client version 4.6.2\n# pgo-apiserver version 4.6.2\n```\n\n\nYou can then create a cluster with the `pgo` client as simply as this:\n\n```\npgo create cluster -n pgo hippo\n```\n\nThe cluster may take a few moments to provision. You can verify that the cluster is up and running by using the `pgo test` command:\n\n```\npgo test cluster -n pgo hippo\n```\n\nIf you have the PostgreSQL client `psql` installed on your host machine, you can\ntest connection to the PostgreSQL cluster using the following command:\n\n```\n# namespace that the cluster is running in\nexport PGO_OPERATOR_NAMESPACE=pgo\n# name of the cluster\nexport pgo_cluster_name=hippo\n# name of the user whose password we want to get\nexport pgo_cluster_username=hippo\n\n# get the password of the user and set it to a recognized psql environmental variable\nexport PGPASSWORD=$(kubectl -n \"${PGO_OPERATOR_NAMESPACE}\" get secrets \\\n  \"${pgo_cluster_name}-${pgo_cluster_username}-secret\" -o \"jsonpath={.data['password']}\" | base64 -d)\n\n# set up a port-forward either in a new terminal, or in the same terminal in the background:\nkubectl -n pgo port-forward svc/hippo 5432:5432 &\n\npsql -h localhost -U \"${pgo_cluster_username}\" \"${pgo_cluster_name}\"\n```",

The [Couch Replication Protocol](http://docs.couchdb.org/en/master/replication/protocol.html) is implemented in a variety of projects and products that span every imaginable computing environment from globally distributed server-clusters, over mobile phones to web browsers.\n\nStore your data safely, on your own servers, or with any leading cloud provider. Your web- and native applications love CouchDB, because it speaks JSON natively and supports binary data for all your data storage needs.\n\nThe [Couch Replication Protocol](http://docs.couchdb.org/en/master/replication/protocol.html) lets your data flow seamlessly between server clusters to mobile phones and web browsers, enabling a compelling [offline-first](http://offlinefirst.org/) user-experience while maintaining high performance and strong reliability. CouchDB comes with a developer-friendly query language, and optionally MapReduce for simple, efficient, and comprehensive data retrieval.\n\n### Operator for Apache CouchDB Features\n* Fully automated deployment and configuration of Apache CouchDB clusters.\n* Support single, multiple, or all namespace install modes.\n\n#### Security\n* TLS - TLS  is supported using Red Hat Service certificates or user-provided certificates.\n* Authentication - The parameter `require_valid_user` defaults to `true`, which means that no requests are allowed from anonymous users. Every request must be authenticated.\n* Authorization - Databases are initially accessible by Apache CouchDB admins only.\n\n#### High Availability\n* Nodes - Each database node in an Apache CouchDB cluster requires its own Kubernetes node. It's recommended that you run it with a minimum of three nodes for any production deployment.\n* Zones - The Apache CouchDB cluster database nodes are spread across available Kubernetes fault zones where available.\n* Replicas - The default configuration for each database is two shards (Q=2) and three shard copies (N=3), where each shard copy is deployed on a separate node in the cluster.\n\n### Reading and writing to Apache CouchDB\n\nThe Operator for Apache CouchDB automatically generates a Service. This can be accessed using port-forwarding e.g. `kubectl port-forward svc/my-couchdb-cluster 443:443 -u admin:mypassword`. Alternatively, configure an OpenShift Route to expose the service externally.\n\n[Read the complete guide to using the Operator for Apache CouchDB](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/services/Cloudant?topic=cloudant-apache-couchdb-operator)\n",

The [Couch Replication Protocol](http://docs.couchdb.org/en/master/replication/protocol.html) is implemented in a variety of projects and products that span every imaginable computing environment from globally distributed server-clusters, over mobile phones to web browsers.\n\nStore your data safely, on your own servers, or with any leading cloud provider. Your web- and native applications love CouchDB, because it speaks JSON natively and supports binary data for all your data storage needs.\n\nThe [Couch Replication Protocol](http://docs.couchdb.org/en/master/replication/protocol.html) lets your data flow seamlessly between server clusters to mobile phones and web browsers, enabling a compelling [offline-first](http://offlinefirst.org/) user-experience while maintaining high performance and strong reliability. CouchDB comes with a developer-friendly query language, and optionally MapReduce for simple, efficient, and comprehensive data retrieval.\n\n### Operator for Apache CouchDB Features\n* Fully automated deployment and configuration of Apache CouchDB clusters.\n* Support single, multiple, or all namespace install modes.\n\n#### Security\n* TLS - TLS  is supported using Red Hat Service certificates or user-provided certificates.\n* Authentication - The parameter `require_valid_user` defaults to `true`, which means that no requests are allowed from anonymous users. Every request must be authenticated.\n* Authorization - Databases are initially accessible by Apache CouchDB admins only.\n\n#### High Availability\n* Nodes - Each database node in an Apache CouchDB cluster requires its own Kubernetes node. It's recommended that you run it with a minimum of three nodes for any production deployment.\n* Zones - The Apache CouchDB cluster database nodes are spread across available Kubernetes fault zones where available.\n* Replicas - The default configuration for each database is two shards (Q=2) and three shard copies (N=3), where each shard copy is deployed on a separate node in the cluster.\n\n### Reading and writing to Apache CouchDB\n\nThe Operator for Apache CouchDB automatically generates a Service. This can be accessed using port-forwarding e.g. `kubectl port-forward svc/my-couchdb-cluster 443:443 -u admin:mypassword`. Alternatively, configure an OpenShift Route to expose the service externally.\n\n[Read the complete guide to using the Operator for Apache CouchDB](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/services/Cloudant?topic=cloudant-apache-couchdb-operator)\n",

      "csv_description": "Excelero NVMesh is a low-latency distributed block storage solution providing web-scale applications access to hot data in any cloud, private or public. NVMesh enables pooling and sharing NVMe across any network. It drives both local and distributed file systems. The solution features an intelligent management layer that abstracts underlying hardware with CPU offload, creates logical volumes with redundancy and provides centralized, intelligent management and monitoring. Applications can enjoy the latency, throughput and IO/s of local NVMe devices with the convenience of centralized storage while avoiding proprietary hardware lock-in and reducing the overall storage TCO. In public cloud environments, NVMesh supports instances, both virtualized and containerized, that feature NVMe drives. Public cloud instances with local NVMe drives have become widely available allowing easy transition between on-premises and public cloud deployments of NVMesh.\n\nExcelero NVMesh has a flexible distributed data protection architecture providing multiple redundancy schemes that can be tuned for specific use cases and data center restrictions and requirements to ensure reliability and to reduce cost. The system can also work around failure to strive for maximal data availability. In NVMesh, drives are perceived as resources that are pooled into a large storage area. Logical volumes are then carved out of the storage area and presented to clients as block devices. Volumes may span multiple physical drives and target hosts, but do not need to use entire drives, so a single drive can be allocated to multiple volumes.\n\nVolumes can be configured in any of the following redundancy levels:\n\n**Concatenated** \u2013 Data is laid out on a single or multiple drives with no data redundancy. This volume type can be used for applications requiring temporary storage. Failures are typically isolated to a single device or host.\n\n**Striped** \u2013 Data is laid out across a set of drives and hosts with no data redundancy. This volume type can be used for applications requiring high performance temporary storage.\n\n**Mirrored** \u2013 Data is protected by mirroring data across drive segments. To increase data availability, the drive segments are allocated from drives on different target hosts. These hosts should be connected to different power supplies, preferably in separate upgrade zones and availability zones and any other zoning used to protect against risk. The software\u2019s management layer provides the agility to ensure such separation. Multi-way, active-active multipath networking is used for availability and for performance.\n\n**Striped** and Mirrored \u2013 Data is protected by mirroring data across drive segments and striping across these mirrors. Data is serviced from many drives and hosts, achieving high performance without sacrificing redundancy.\n\nFor details on licensing, support and usage under Red Hat OpenShift please access [https://www.excelero.com/openshift](https://www.excelero.com/openshift)\n",

It allows the optimization of data plane performance to reduce total cost of ownership while maintaining a high degree of flexibility.  The Intel FPGA PAC N3000 plays a key role in accelerating 5G and network functions virtualization (NFV) adoption for ecosystem partners such as telecommunications equipment manufacturers (TEMs) virtual network functions (VNF) vendors, system integrators and telcos, to bring scalable and high-performance solutions to market. The Intel FPGA PAC N3000 includes a variant that is design to be Network Equipment Building System (NEBS)-friendly, and features a Root-of-Trust device that helps protect systems from FPGA host security exploits. This document explains how the FPGA resource can be used on the Open Network Edge Services Software (OpenNESS) platform for accelerating network functions and edge application workloads. We use the Intel\u00ae FPGA PAC N3000 as a reference FPGA PAC and use LTE/5G Forward Error Correction (FEC) as an example workload that accelerates the 5G or 4G L1 base station network function. The same concept and mechanism is applicable for application acceleration workloads like AI and ML on FPGA for Inference applications. The Intel\u00ae FPGA PAC N3000 is a full-duplex, 100 Gbps in-system, re-programmable acceleration card for multi-workload networking application acceleration. It has an optimal memory mixture designed for network functions, with an integrated network interface card (NIC) in a small form factor that enables high throughput, low latency, and low power per bit for a custom networking pipeline.",

The Intel\u00ae FPGA PAC N3000 is a full-duplex, 100 Gbps in-system, re-programmable acceleration card for multi-workload networking application acceleration. It has an optimal memory mixture designed for network functions, with an integrated network interface card (NIC) in a small form factor that enables high throughput, low latency, and low power per bit for a custom networking pipeline. The ACC100 supports the O-RAN adopted DPDK BBDev API - an API which Intel contributed to the opensource community to enable choice and TTM for FEC acceleration solutions. The FlexRAN software reference architecture supports the ACC100 which enables users to quickly evaluate and build platforms for the wide range of vRAN networks. Reduces platform power, E2E latency and Intel\u00ae CPU core count requirements as well as increases cell capacity than existing programmable accelerator. Accelerates both 4G and 5G data concurrently.\tLowers development cost using commercial off the shelf (COTS) servers. Accommodates space-constrained implementations via a low-profile PCIe card form factor. Enables a variety of flexible FlexRAN deployments from small cell to macro to Massive MIMO networks. Supports extended temperature for the most challenging of RAN deployment scenario\u2019s.",

It allows the optimization of data plane performance to reduce total cost of ownership while maintaining a high degree of flexibility.  The Intel FPGA PAC N3000 plays a key role in accelerating 5G and network functions virtualization (NFV) adoption for ecosystem partners such as telecommunications equipment manufacturers (TEMs) virtual network functions (VNF) vendors, system integrators and telcos, to bring scalable and high-performance solutions to market. The Intel FPGA PAC N3000 includes a variant that is design to be Network Equipment Building System (NEBS)-friendly, and features a Root-of-Trust device that helps protect systems from FPGA host security exploits. This document explains how the FPGA resource can be used on the Open Network Edge Services Software (OpenNESS) platform for accelerating network functions and edge application workloads. We use the Intel\u00ae FPGA PAC N3000 as a reference FPGA PAC and use LTE/5G Forward Error Correction (FEC) as an example workload that accelerates the 5G or 4G L1 base station network function. The same concept and mechanism is applicable for application acceleration workloads like AI and ML on FPGA for Inference applications. The Intel\u00ae FPGA PAC N3000 is a full-duplex, 100 Gbps in-system, re-programmable acceleration card for multi-workload networking application acceleration.

Please skip these versions.\n\n## Overview\nOpenshift Operator to deploy JFrog Artifactory Enterprise into your Openshift cluster.\n## Security Context Constraints\nTo deploy this helm chart you will need to be a cluster admin w/ access to the anyuid scc and add the operator service account to the anyuid scc.\n```\noc adm policy add-scc-to-user anyuid -z artifactory-ha-operator -n openshift-operators\n```\nAdd the service account for the Artifactory chart to deploy successfully:\n``` oc adm policy add-scc-to-user anyuid -z openshiftartifactoryha-artifactory-ha -n artifactory ```\n### Usage\n\nAn external DB is required. The operator will not deploy a DB but will require you to specify the configuration values to connect to it.\n\nSearch for JFrog and click JFrog Artifactory Enterprise Operator to install.\n\nGo to the Installed Operators.\n\nWait for the JFrog Artifactory Enterprise Operator to complete the installation.\n\nOpen the Operator and click on the provided API: Artifactory HA.\n\nClick Create New Instance and provide the following parameters for your DB configuration:\n\n```\nDATABASE_TYPE\nDATABASE_DRIVER\nDATABASE_URL\nDATABASE_USER\nDATABASE_PASSWORD\n```\nMaster key and Join key must be supplied. To generate a new key for each run the command below:\n\n```\n# Create a key\nexport JOIN_KEY=$(openssl rand -hex 32)\necho ${JOIN_KEY}\n```\n\nTo use TLS you will need to first create a k8s tls secret to store your .crt and .key file into.\nThen supply the value of this k8s secret into the TLS_SECRET field.\n``` oc create secret tls my_tls_secret --cert=tls.crt --key=tls.key --namespace=my_namespace ```\nClick Create for Artifactory Enterprise to deploy into OpenShift and connect to it on the external IP exposed by the load balancer.\n### Create a route\nTo expose Artifactory from Openshift we recommend you create a new route in Openshift.\nYou can either use the oc command line tool or the Openshift web console to generate a new route.\nDepending upon where you terminate TLS you will need to either specify pass through or edge.\nCommand Line (Edge):\n``` oc create route edge --service=openshiftartifactory-ha --cert=tls.crt --key=tls.key --ca-cert=ca.crt --hostname=www.example.com ```\nOr for more information visit the official Openshift documentation on routes here:\nhttps://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.6/networking/routes/route-configuration.html\n\n",

      "csv_description": "The Intel\u00ae FPGA Programmable Acceleration Card N3000 (Intel\u00ae FPGA PAC N3000) is a highly customizable FPGA SmartNIC which enables high-throughput, low latency and high-bandwith applications.  It allows the optimization of data plane performance to reduce total cost of ownership while maintaining a high degree of flexibility.  The Intel FPGA PAC N3000 plays a key role in accelerating 5G and network functions virtualization (NFV) adoption for ecosystem partners such as telecommunications equipment manufacturers (TEMs) virtual network functions (VNF) vendors, system integrators and telcos, to bring scalable and high-performance solutions to market. The Intel FPGA PAC N3000 includes a variant that is design to be Network Equipment Building System (NEBS)-friendly, and features a Root-of-Trust device that helps protect systems from FPGA host security exploits. This document explains how the FPGA resource can be used on the Open Network Edge Services Software (OpenNESS) platform for accelerating network functions and edge application workloads. We use the Intel\u00ae FPGA PAC N3000 as a reference FPGA PAC and use LTE/5G Forward Error Correction (FEC) as an example workload that accelerates the 5G or 4G L1 base station network function. The same concept and mechanism is applicable for application acceleration workloads like AI and ML on FPGA for Inference applications. The Intel\u00ae FPGA PAC N3000 is a full-duplex, 100 Gbps in-system, re-programmable acceleration card for multi-workload networking application acceleration. It has an optimal memory mixture designed for network functions, with an integrated network interface card (NIC) in a small form factor that enables high throughput, low latency, and low power per bit for a custom networking pipeline. The ACC100 supports the O-RAN adopted DPDK BBDev API - an API which Intel contributed to the opensource community to enable choice and TTM for FEC acceleration solutions. The FlexRAN software reference architecture supports the ACC100 which enables users to quickly evaluate and build platforms for the wide range of vRAN networks. Reduces platform power, E2E latency and Intel\u00ae CPU core count requirements as well as increases cell capacity than existing programmable accelerator. Accelerates both 4G and 5G data concurrently.\tLowers development cost using commercial off the shelf (COTS) servers. Accommodates space-constrained implementations via a low-profile PCIe card form factor. Enables a variety of flexible FlexRAN deployments from small cell to macro to Massive MIMO networks. Supports extended temperature for the most challenging of RAN deployment scenario\u2019s.",

When a newer microcode version becomes available, contact IBM Support to inquire whether the new microcode version is compatible with the current version of the CSI driver.\n-   The IBM Spectrum Virtualize Family and IBM SAN Volume Controller storage systems run the IBM Spectrum Virtualize software. In addition, IBM Spectrum Virtualize package is available as a deployable solution that can be run on any compatible hardware.\n## Supported operating systems\nThe following table lists operating systems required for deployment of the IBM\u00ae block storage CSI driver.\n|Operating system|Architecture|\n|----------------|------------|\n|Red Hat\u00ae Enterprise Linux\u00ae (RHEL) 7.x|x86, IBM Z\u00ae|\n|Red Hat Enterprise Linux CoreOS (RHCOS)|x86, IBM Z\u00ae\u00b2, IBM Power Systems\u2122\u00b9|\n\n\u00b9 IBM Power Systems architecture is only supported on Spectrum Virtualize Family storage systems.\n\n\u00b2 IBM Z and IBM Power Systems architectures are only supported using CLI installation.\n\nFor full product information, see [IBM block storage CSI driver documentation](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/stg-block-csi-driver).\n## Prerequisites\nPerform these steps for each worker node in Kubernetes cluster to prepare your environment for installing the CSI (Container Storage Interface) driver.\n### 1. **For RHEL OS users:** Ensure iSCSI connectivity. If using RHCOS or if the packages are already installed, skip this step and continue to step 2.\n### 2. Configure Linux\u00ae multipath devices on the host.\n**Important:** Be sure to configure each worker with storage connectivity according to your storage system instructions. For more information, find your storage system documentation in [IBM Documentation](http://www.ibm.com/docs/).\n\n**Additional configuration steps for OpenShift\u00ae Container Platform users (RHEL and RHCOS).** Other users can continue to step 3.\n\nDownload and save the following yaml file:\n\n```bash\ncurl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/IBM/ibm-block-csi-operator/master/deploy/99-ibm-attach.yaml > 99-ibm-attach.yaml\n```\n\nThis file can be used for both Fibre Channel and iSCSI configurations. To support iSCSI, uncomment the last two lines in the file.\n\n**Important:** The 99-ibm-attach.yaml configuration file overrides any files that already exist on your system. Only use this file if the files mentioned are not already created. <br />If one or more have been created, edit this yaml file, as necessary.\nApply the yaml file.\n\n```bash\noc apply -f 99-ibm-attach.yaml\n```\n\n### 3. If needed, enable support for volume snapshots (FlashCopy\u00ae function) on your Kubernetes cluster.\n\nFor more information and instructions, see the Kubernetes blog post, [Kubernetes 1.20: Kubernetes Volume Snapshot Moves to GA](https://kubernetes.io/blog/2020/12/10/kubernetes-1.20-volume-snapshot-moves-to-ga/).\nInstall both the Snapshot CRDs and the Common Snapshot Controller once per cluster.\n\nThe instructions and relevant yaml files to enable volume snapshots can be found at: [https://github.com/kubernetes-csi/external-snapshotter#usage](https://github.com/kubernetes-csi/external-snapshotter#usage)\n### 4.  Configure storage system connectivity.\n#### 4.1.  Define the host of each Kubernetes node on the relevant storage systems with the valid WWPN (for Fibre Channel) or IQN (for iSCSI) of the node.\n#### 4.2.  For Fibre Channel, configure the relevant zoning from the storage to the host.\n### Installation\n#### Installing the driver with GitHub\nThe operator for IBM\u00ae block storage CSI driver can be installed directly with GitHub. Installing the CSI (Container Storage Interface) driver is part of the operator installation process.\nUse the following steps to install the operator and driver, with [GitHub](https://github.com/IBM/ibm-block-csi-operator).\n\n**Note:** Before you begin, you may need to create a user-defined namespace. Create the project namespace, using the `kubectl create ns <namespace>` command.\n#### 1.  Install the operator.\n##### 1.1. Download the manifest from GitHub.\n```bash\ncurl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/IBM/ibm-block-csi-operator/v1.6.0/deploy/installer/generated/ibm-block-csi-operator.yaml > ibm-block-csi-operator.yaml\n```\n##### 1.2.  (Optional): Update the image fields in the ibm-block-csi-operator.yaml.\n##### 1.3. Install the operator, using a user-defined namespace.\n```bash\n$ kubectl -n <namespace> apply -f ibm-block-csi-operator.yamlA\n```\n##### 4. Verify that the operator is running. (Make sure that the Status is _Running_.)\n```bash\n$ kubectl get pod -l app.kubernetes.io/name=ibm-block-csi-operator -n <namespace>\nNAME                                    READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE\nibm-block-csi-operator-5bb7996b86-xntss 1/1     Running   0          10m\n```\n#### 2.  Install the IBM block storage CSI driver by creating an IBMBlockCSI custom resource.\n##### 2.1.  Download the manifest from GitHub.\n```bash\ncurl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/IBM/ibm-block-csi-operator/v1.6.0/deploy/crds/csi.ibm.com_v1_ibmblockcsi_cr.yaml > csi.ibm.com_v1_ibmblockcsi_cr.yaml\n```\n##### 2.2.  (Optional): Update the image repository field, tag field, or both in the csi.ibm.com_v1_ibmblockcsi_cr.yaml.\n##### 2.3.  Install the csi.ibm.com_v1_ibmblockcsi_cr.yaml.\n```bash\n$ kubectl -n <namespace> apply -f csi.ibm.com_v1_ibmblockcsi_cr.yaml\n```\n##### 2.4. Verify the driver is running:\n```bash\n$ kubectl get pods -n <namespace> -l csi\nNAME                                        READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE\nibm-block-csi-controller-0                  6/6     Running   0          9m36s\nibm-block-csi-node-jvmvh                    3/3     Running   0          9m36s\nibm-block-csi-node-tsppw                    3/3     Running   0          9m36s\nibm-block-csi-operator-5bb7996b86-xntss     1/1     Running   0          10m\n```\n## Configuring k8s secret and storage class\nIn order to use the driver, create the relevant storage classes and secrets, as needed.\nThis section describes how to:\n 1. Create a storage system secret - to define the storage system credentials (user and password) and its address.\n 2. Configure the storage class - to define the storage system pool name, secret reference, `SpaceEfficiency`, and `fstype`.\n#### 1. Create an array secret\nCreate a secret file as follows `array-secret.yaml` and update the relevant credentials:\n```\nkind: Secret\napiVersion: v1\nmetadata:\n  name: <NAME>\n  namespace: <NAMESPACE>\ntype: Opaque\nstringData:\n  management_address: <ADDRESS-1, ADDRESS-2> # Array management addresses\n  username: <USERNAME>                   # Array username\ndata:\n  password: <PASSWORD base64>            # Array password\n```\nApply the secret:\n```\n$ kubectl apply -f array-secret.yaml\n```\nTo create the secret using a command line terminal, use the following command:\n```bash\nkubectl create secret generic <NAME> --from-literal=username=<USER> --fromliteral=password=<PASSWORD> --from-literal=management_address=<ARRAY_MGMT> -n <namespace>\n```\n#### 2. Create storage classes\nCreate a storage class `demo-storageclass-gold-pvc.yaml` file as follows, with the relevant capabilities, pool and, array secret.\nUse the `SpaceEfficiency` parameters for each storage system. These values are not case sensitive:\n* IBM FlashSystem A9000 and A9000R\n    * Always includes deduplication and compression.\n    No need to specify during configuration.\n* IBM Spectrum Virtualize Family\n    * `thick` (default value, if not specified)\n    * `thin`\n    * `compressed`\n    * `deduplicated`\n* IBM DS8000 Family\n    * `none` (default value, if not specified)\n    * `thin`\n```\nkind: StorageClass\napiVersion: storage.k8s.io/v1\nmetadata:\n  name: gold\nprovisioner: block.csi.ibm.com\nparameters:\n  SpaceEfficiency: <VALUE>          # Optional: Values applicable for Spectrum Virtualize Family are: thin, compressed, or deduplicated\n  pool: <POOL_NAME>\t                # DS8000 Family paramater is pool ID\n  csi.storage.k8s.io/provisioner-secret-name: <ARRAY_SECRET>\n  csi.storage.k8s.io/provisioner-secret-namespace: <ARRAY_SECRET_NAMESPACE>\n  csi.storage.k8s.io/controller-publish-secret-name: <ARRAY_SECRET>\n  csi.storage.k8s.io/controller-publish-secret-namespace: <ARRAY_SECRET_NAMESPACE>\n  csi.storage.k8s.io/controller-expand-secret-name: <ARRAY_SECRET>\n  csi.storage.k8s.io/controller-expand-secret-namespace: <ARRAY_SECRET_NAMESPACE>\n  csi.storage.k8s.io/fstype: xfs    # Optional: Values ext4/xfs. The default is ext4.\n  volume_name_prefix: <prefix_name> # Optional: DS8000 Family maximum prefix length is 5 characters. Maximum prefix length for other systems is 20 characters.\nallowVolumeExpansion: true\n```\n#### 3. Apply the storage class:\n```bash\n$ kubectl apply -f demo-storageclass-gold-pvc.yaml\nstorageclass.storage.k8s.io/gold created\n```\n",
