Make sure you have a license and to obtain one, please contact Aqua Security at [Contact Us](mailto:cloudsales@aquasec.com).\n2. Create a new project for aqua\n\n    ```oc new-project aqua```\n\n3. Create the secret for Aqua Database password. If you are using an External Database, make sure you use those credentials.\nNOTE: This step is optional and you can specify the Database password when creating the CRs.\n\n    ```oc create secret generic aqua-database-password --from-literal=db-password=<password> -n aqua```\n\nPlease note that for the certified operator, the Docker registry secret is NOT needed. For the Red Hat certified operator, the Aqua application images are stored in the Red Hat Connect registry and will be automatically pulled by the Aqua operator.\n\n## Choosing the right channel\n\nChannels are a flexible publishing mechanism that offers you three different Aqua versions to deploy, at any point. These channels map to their respective Aqua versions, describing the maturity based on where they are in their lifecycle:\n* 4.6: This maps to the older version of Aqua 4.6.0\n* 5.0: This maps to the Aqua version 5.0.0\n* 5.3: This maps to the Aqua version 5.3.0\n* 6.0: This maps to the Aqua version 6.0.0\n* 6.2: This is the latest and greatest version of Aqua (default)\n\n## Deploying the Aqua Operator\n\nAqua Operator follows an easy push button deployment that installs the operator in its own aqua namespace.\nPlease refer to the instructions [here](https://github.com/aquasecurity/aqua-operator/blob/6.0.0/docs/DeployOpenShiftOperator.md).\n\n## Configuring the Aqua Operator\n\nOperators leverage CRDs as a configuration mechanism for the application. Aqua offers a number of CRDs that can be tweaked and configured as per your needs. Please refer to this [link](https://github.com/aquasecurity/aqua-operator/blob/6.0.0/docs/DeployOpenShiftOperator.md#aquacsp-crds) for Custom Resource examples for popular scenarios.\n\n## Support\n\nFor support please contact support@aquasec.com.",

Make sure you have a license and to obtain one, please contact Aqua Security at [Contact Us](mailto:cloudsales@aquasec.com).\n2. Create a new project for aqua\n\n    ```oc new-project aqua```\n3. Create the secret for Aqua Database password\n\n    ```oc create secret generic aqua-database-password --from-literal=db-password=<password>```\n    \nPlease note that for the certified operator, the Docker registry secret is NOT needed. For the Red Hat certified operator, the Aqua application images are stored in the Red Hat Connect registry and will be automatically pulled by the Aqua operator.\n\n## Choosing the right channel\n\nChannels are a flexible publishing mechanism that offers you three different Aqua versions to deploy, at any point. These channels map to their respective Aqua versions, describing the maturity based on where they are in their lifecycle:\n* latest: This maps to the Aqua version 4.6.0\n* alpha: This maps to the Aqua version 5.0.0\n* 5.3: This is the latest and greatest version of Aqua (default)\n\n## Deploying the Aqua Operator\n\nAqua Operator follows an easy push button deployment that installs the operator in its own aqua namespace.\nPlease refer to the instructions [here](https://github.com/aquasecurity/aqua-operator/blob/5.3.0/docs/DeployOpenShiftOperator.md).\n\n## Configuring the Aqua Operator\n\nOperators leverage CRDs as a configuration mechanism for the application. Aqua offers a number of CRDs that can be tweaked and configured as per your needs. Please refer to this [link](https://github.com/aquasecurity/aqua-operator/blob/5.3.0/docs/DeployOpenShiftOperator.md#aquacsp-crds) for Custom Resource examples for popular scenarios.\n\n## Support\n\nFor support please contact support@aquasec.com.",

It enrolls all the nodes in the openshift cluster to a particular CCM account. You have to provide the base64 encode of join token of CCM account while creating CcmNodeAgent resource.\n\n## Prerequisites\nAll the worker nodes in the cluster must have SGX capabilities, in-kernel driver installed and fsgsbase support.\n\n## Installation\n * Choose a namespace to install the Operator. \n Operator will be available in all namespaces.\n* Select Approval Strategy: Available options are Automatic or Manual. Automatic approval will automatically upgrade the running instance of your Operator without human intervention when a new version is available. In case of Manual approval, when a new version is available, OLM will create an update request. You must manually approve the request to update the Operator to a new version.\n* Generate your CCM Account Join Token: Please log in to https://ccm.fortanix.com, and in the Management Console tab, click the + ENROLL NODE button. In the ENROLL NODE screen, a Join Token will be generated in the text box for \"Get a join token to register an SGX compute node\". This Join Token is used by the compute node to authenticate itself.\n* Base64 encode the Join Token:\n```shell\necho -n <join-token> | openssl base64 -A\n```\n* Create an instance of CcmNodeAgent by setting the `spec.ccmJoinToken.Token` to the base64 encoded CCM account join token.\n* After CcmNodeAgent resource is installed successfully you should be able to see all the worker nodes of the cluster in your CCM account under Compute Node Tab.\n\n## Getting Started\nNow to run your application inside SGX enclaves on your cluster follow the [documentation](https://support.fortanix.com/hc/en-us/articles/360043527431-User-s-Guide-Add-and-Edit-an-Application).\n",

It enrolls all the nodes in the openshift cluster to a particular CCM account. You have to provide the base64 encode of join token of CCM account while creating CcmNodeAgent resource.\n\n## Prerequisites\nAll the worker nodes in the cluster must have SGX capabilities.\n\n## Installation\n* Choose a namespace to install the Operator. Operator will be available in all namespaces.\n* Select Approval Strategy: Available options are Automatic or Manual. Automatic approval will automatically upgrade the running instance of your Operator without human intervention when a new version is available. In case of Manual approval, when a new version is available, OLM will create an update request. You must manually approve the request to update the Operator to a new version.\n* Generate your CCM Account Join Token: Please log in to https://ccm.fortanix.com, and in the Management Console tab, click the + ENROLL NODE button. In the ENROLL NODE screen, a Join Token will be generated in the text box for \"Get a join token to register an SGX compute node\". This Join Token is used by the compute node to authenticate itself.\n* Base64 encode the Join Token:\n```shell\necho -n <join-token> | openssl base64 -A\n```\n* Create an instance of CcmNodeAgent by setting the `spec.ccmJoinToken.Token` to the base64 encoded CCM account join token.\n* After CcmNodeAgent resource is installed successfully you should be able to see all the worker nodes of the cluster in your CCM account under Compute Node Tab.\n\n## Getting Started\nNow to run your application inside SGX enclaves on your cluster follow the [documentation](https://support.fortanix.com/hc/en-us/articles/360043527431-User-s-Guide-Add-and-Edit-an-Application).\n",

      "csv_description": "The Intel\u00ae FPGA Programmable Acceleration Card N3000 (Intel\u00ae FPGA PAC N3000) is a highly customizable FPGA SmartNIC which enables high-throughput, low latency and high-bandwith applications.  It allows the optimization of data plane performance to reduce total cost of ownership while maintaining a high degree of flexibility.  The Intel FPGA PAC N3000 plays a key role in accelerating 5G and network functions virtualization (NFV) adoption for ecosystem partners such as telecommunications equipment manufacturers (TEMs) virtual network functions (VNF) vendors, system integrators and telcos, to bring scalable and high-performance solutions to market. The Intel FPGA PAC N3000 includes a variant that is design to be Network Equipment Building System (NEBS)-friendly, and features a Root-of-Trust device that helps protect systems from FPGA host security exploits. This document explains how the FPGA resource can be used on the Smart Edge Open (SEO) platform for accelerating network functions and edge application workloads. We use the Intel\u00ae FPGA PAC N3000 as a reference FPGA PAC and use LTE/5G Forward Error Correction (FEC) as an example workload that accelerates the 5G or 4G L1 base station network function. The same concept and mechanism is applicable for application acceleration workloads like AI and ML on FPGA for Inference applications. The Intel\u00ae FPGA PAC N3000 is a full-duplex, 100 Gbps in-system, re-programmable acceleration card for multi-workload networking application acceleration. It has an optimal memory mixture designed for network functions, with an integrated network interface card (NIC) in a small form factor that enables high throughput, low latency, and low power per bit for a custom networking pipeline. The ACC100 supports the O-RAN adopted DPDK BBDev API - an API which Intel contributed to the opensource community to enable choice and TTM for FEC acceleration solutions. The FlexRAN software reference architecture supports the ACC100 which enables users to quickly evaluate and build platforms for the wide range of vRAN networks. Reduces platform power, E2E latency and Intel\u00ae CPU core count requirements as well as increases cell capacity than existing programmable accelerator. Accelerates both 4G and 5G data concurrently.\tLowers development cost using commercial off the shelf (COTS) servers. Accommodates space-constrained implementations via a low-profile PCIe card form factor. Enables a variety of flexible FlexRAN deployments from small cell to macro to Massive MIMO networks. Supports extended temperature for the most challenging of RAN deployment scenario\u2019s.",

The server provides an inference service via gRPC or REST API for any models trained in a framework that is supported by [OpenVINO](https://software.intel.com/en-us/openvino-toolki://docs.openvino.ai/latest/index.html).\nModel Server configuration parameters is explained [here](https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/operator/blob/main/docs/modelserver_params.md).\n## Using the cluster\nOpenVINO Model Server can be consumed as a `Service`. It is called like with `ModelServer` resource with `-ovms` suffix.\nThe suffix is ommited when `ovms` phrase is included in the name.\nThe service exposes gRPC and REST API interfaces to run inference requests.\n```\noc get pods\nNAME                                        READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE\nmodel-server-sample-ovms-586f6f76df-dpps4   1/1     Running   0          8h\n\noc get services\nNAME                       TYPE        CLUSTER-IP       EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)             AGE\nmodel-server-sample-ovms   ClusterIP   172.25.199.210   <none>        8080/TCP,8081/TCP   8h\n```\n\n# Notebook\nThe Notebook resource integrates JupyterHub from OpenShift Data Science or Open Data Hub with a container image that includes [developer\ntools](https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/openvino/blob/master/docs/install_guides/pypi-openvino-dev.md)\nfrom the OpenVINO toolkit and a set of Jupyter notebook tutorials.

It enrolls all the nodes in the openshift cluster to a particular CCM account. You have to provide the base64 encode of join token of CCM account while creating CcmNodeAgent resource.\n\n## Prerequisites\nAll the worker nodes in the cluster must have SGX capabilities, in-kernel driver installed and fsgsbase support.\n\n## Installation\n * Choose a namespace to install the Operator. \n Operator will be available in all namespaces.\n* Select Approval Strategy: Available options are Automatic or Manual. Automatic approval will automatically upgrade the running instance of your Operator without human intervention when a new version is available. In case of Manual approval, when a new version is available, OLM will create an update request. You must manually approve the request to update the Operator to a new version.\n* Generate your CCM Account Join Token: Please log in to https://ccm.fortanix.com, and in the Management Console tab, click the + ENROLL NODE button. In the ENROLL NODE screen, a Join Token will be generated in the text box for \"Get a join token to register an SGX compute node\". This Join Token is used by the compute node to authenticate itself.\n* Base64 encode the Join Token:\n```shell\necho -n <join-token> | openssl base64 -A\n```\n* Create an instance of CcmNodeAgent by setting the `spec.ccmJoinToken.Token` to the base64 encoded CCM account join token.\n* After CcmNodeAgent resource is installed successfully you should be able to see all the worker nodes of the cluster in your CCM account under Compute Node Tab.\n\n## Getting Started\nNow to run your application inside SGX enclaves on your cluster follow the [documentation](https://support.fortanix.com/hc/en-us/articles/360043527431-User-s-Guide-Add-and-Edit-an-Application).\n",

It enrolls all the nodes in the openshift cluster to a particular CCM account. You have to provide the base64 encode of join token of CCM account while creating CcmNodeAgent resource.\n\n## Prerequisites\nAll the worker nodes in the cluster must have SGX capabilities.\n\n## Installation\n* Choose a namespace to install the Operator. Operator will be available in all namespaces.\n* Select Approval Strategy: Available options are Automatic or Manual. Automatic approval will automatically upgrade the running instance of your Operator without human intervention when a new version is available. In case of Manual approval, when a new version is available, OLM will create an update request. You must manually approve the request to update the Operator to a new version.\n* Generate your CCM Account Join Token: Please log in to https://ccm.fortanix.com, and in the Management Console tab, click the + ENROLL NODE button. In the ENROLL NODE screen, a Join Token will be generated in the text box for \"Get a join token to register an SGX compute node\". This Join Token is used by the compute node to authenticate itself.\n* Base64 encode the Join Token:\n```shell\necho -n <join-token> | openssl base64 -A\n```\n* Create an instance of CcmNodeAgent by setting the `spec.ccmJoinToken.Token` to the base64 encoded CCM account join token.\n* After CcmNodeAgent resource is installed successfully you should be able to see all the worker nodes of the cluster in your CCM account under Compute Node Tab.\n\n## Getting Started\nNow to run your application inside SGX enclaves on your cluster follow the [documentation](https://support.fortanix.com/hc/en-us/articles/360043527431-User-s-Guide-Add-and-Edit-an-Application).\n",
