It allows the optimization of data plane performance to reduce total cost of ownership while maintaining a high degree of flexibility.  The Intel FPGA PAC N3000 plays a key role in accelerating 5G and network functions virtualization (NFV) adoption for ecosystem partners such as telecommunications equipment manufacturers (TEMs) virtual network functions (VNF) vendors, system integrators and telcos, to bring scalable and high-performance solutions to market. The Intel FPGA PAC N3000 includes a variant that is design to be Network Equipment Building System (NEBS)-friendly, and features a Root-of-Trust device that helps protect systems from FPGA host security exploits. This document explains how the FPGA resource can be used on the Smart Edge Open (SEO) platform for accelerating network functions and edge application workloads. We use the Intel\u00ae FPGA PAC N3000 as a reference FPGA PAC and use LTE/5G Forward Error Correction (FEC) as an example workload that accelerates the 5G or 4G L1 base station network function. The same concept and mechanism is applicable for application acceleration workloads like AI and ML on FPGA for Inference applications. The Intel\u00ae FPGA PAC N3000 is a full-duplex, 100 Gbps in-system, re-programmable acceleration card for multi-workload networking application acceleration. It has an optimal memory mixture designed for network functions, with an integrated network interface card (NIC) in a small form factor that enables high throughput, low latency, and low power per bit for a custom networking pipeline. The ACC100 supports the O-RAN adopted DPDK BBDev API - an API which Intel contributed to the opensource community to enable choice and TTM for FEC acceleration solutions. The FlexRAN software reference architecture supports the ACC100 which enables users to quickly evaluate and build platforms for the wide range of vRAN networks. Reduces platform power, E2E latency and Intel\u00ae CPU core count requirements as well as increases cell capacity than existing programmable accelerator. Accelerates both 4G and 5G data concurrently.\tLowers development cost using commercial off the shelf (COTS) servers. Accommodates space-constrained implementations via a low-profile PCIe card form factor. Enables a variety of flexible FlexRAN deployments from small cell to macro to Massive MIMO networks. Supports extended temperature for the most challenging of RAN deployment scenario\u2019s.",

It allows the optimization of data plane performance to reduce total cost of ownership while maintaining a high degree of flexibility.  The Intel FPGA PAC N3000 plays a key role in accelerating 5G and network functions virtualization (NFV) adoption for ecosystem partners such as telecommunications equipment manufacturers (TEMs) virtual network functions (VNF) vendors, system integrators and telcos, to bring scalable and high-performance solutions to market. The Intel FPGA PAC N3000 includes a variant that is design to be Network Equipment Building System (NEBS)-friendly, and features a Root-of-Trust device that helps protect systems from FPGA host security exploits. This document explains how the FPGA resource can be used on the Smart Edge Open (SEO) platform for accelerating network functions and edge application workloads. We use the Intel\u00ae FPGA PAC N3000 as a reference FPGA PAC and use LTE/5G Forward Error Correction (FEC) as an example workload that accelerates the 5G or 4G L1 base station network function. The same concept and mechanism is applicable for application acceleration workloads like AI and ML on FPGA for Inference applications. The Intel\u00ae FPGA PAC N3000 is a full-duplex, 100 Gbps in-system, re-programmable acceleration card for multi-workload networking application acceleration. It has an optimal memory mixture designed for network functions, with an integrated network interface card (NIC) in a small form factor that enables high throughput, low latency, and low power per bit for a custom networking pipeline. The ACC100 supports the O-RAN adopted DPDK BBDev API - an API which Intel contributed to the opensource community to enable choice and TTM for FEC acceleration solutions. The FlexRAN software reference architecture supports the ACC100 which enables users to quickly evaluate and build platforms for the wide range of vRAN networks. Reduces platform power, E2E latency and Intel\u00ae CPU core count requirements as well as increases cell capacity than existing programmable accelerator. Accelerates both 4G and 5G data concurrently.\tLowers development cost using commercial off the shelf (COTS) servers. Accommodates space-constrained implementations via a low-profile PCIe card form factor. Enables a variety of flexible FlexRAN deployments from small cell to macro to Massive MIMO networks. Supports extended temperature for the most challenging of RAN deployment scenario\u2019s.",

      "csv_description": "The Intel\u00ae FPGA Programmable Acceleration Card N3000 (Intel\u00ae FPGA PAC N3000) is a highly customizable FPGA SmartNIC which enables high-throughput, low latency and high-bandwith applications.  It allows the optimization of data plane performance to reduce total cost of ownership while maintaining a high degree of flexibility.  The Intel FPGA PAC N3000 plays a key role in accelerating 5G and network functions virtualization (NFV) adoption for ecosystem partners such as telecommunications equipment manufacturers (TEMs) virtual network functions (VNF) vendors, system integrators and telcos, to bring scalable and high-performance solutions to market. The Intel FPGA PAC N3000 includes a variant that is design to be Network Equipment Building System (NEBS)-friendly, and features a Root-of-Trust device that helps protect systems from FPGA host security exploits. This document explains how the FPGA resource can be used on the Smart Edge Open (SEO) platform for accelerating network functions and edge application workloads. We use the Intel\u00ae FPGA PAC N3000 as a reference FPGA PAC and use LTE/5G Forward Error Correction (FEC) as an example workload that accelerates the 5G or 4G L1 base station network function. The same concept and mechanism is applicable for application acceleration workloads like AI and ML on FPGA for Inference applications. The Intel\u00ae FPGA PAC N3000 is a full-duplex, 100 Gbps in-system, re-programmable acceleration card for multi-workload networking application acceleration. It has an optimal memory mixture designed for network functions, with an integrated network interface card (NIC) in a small form factor that enables high throughput, low latency, and low power per bit for a custom networking pipeline. The ACC100 supports the O-RAN adopted DPDK BBDev API - an API which Intel contributed to the opensource community to enable choice and TTM for FEC acceleration solutions. The FlexRAN software reference architecture supports the ACC100 which enables users to quickly evaluate and build platforms for the wide range of vRAN networks. Reduces platform power, E2E latency and Intel\u00ae CPU core count requirements as well as increases cell capacity than existing programmable accelerator. Accelerates both 4G and 5G data concurrently.\tLowers development cost using commercial off the shelf (COTS) servers. Accommodates space-constrained implementations via a low-profile PCIe card form factor. Enables a variety of flexible FlexRAN deployments from small cell to macro to Massive MIMO networks. Supports extended temperature for the most challenging of RAN deployment scenario\u2019s.",

      "csv_description": "The Dynatrace Operator supports rollout and lifecycle management of various Dynatrace components in Kubernetes and OpenShift.\n\nCurrently the Dynatrace Operator supports the following capabilities:\n\n### OneAgent\n  * `classicFullStack` rolls out one OneAgent pod per node to monitor its pods and the node itself\n  * `applicationMonitoring` is a webhook based injection mechanism for automatic app-only injection\n  * `hostMonitoring` monitors only the hosts, i.e., the nodes, in the cluster without app-only injection\n### ActiveGate\n  * `routing` routes OneAgent traffic through the ActiveGate\n  * `kubernetes-monitoring` allows monitoring the Kubernetes API\n  * `metrics-ingest` routes enriched metrics through an ActiveGate\n\nFor more information please refer to [our DynaKube Custom Resource examples](https://dt-url.net/dynakube-samples).\n\n### Installation\nOnce you've installed the Dynatrace Operator, you can create a DynaKube custom resource.\n\nFirst, please add a Secret within the Project you've deployed the Dynatrace Operator to, which would contain your API and PaaS tokens. Create tokens of type *Dynatrace API* (`API_TOKEN`) and *Platform as a Service* (`PAAS_TOKEN`) and use their values in the following commands respectively.\n\nFor assistance please refer to [Create user-generated access tokens](https://www.dynatrace.com/support/help/shortlink/token#create-user-generated-access-tokens).\n\n``` $ oc -n <project> create secret generic dynakube --from-literal=\"apiToken=API_TOKEN\" --from-literal=\"paasToken=PAAS_TOKEN\" ```\n\nYou may update this Secret at any time to rotate the tokens.\n\nAfter creation of the secret add the DynaKube object in the project where the Dynatrace Operator has been deployed, configured to your needs.\n\n### Required Parameters\n* `apiUrl` - provide the URL to the API of your Dynatrace environment. In Dynatrace SaaS it will look like `https://<ENVIRONMENTID>.live.dynatrace.com/api` . In Dynatrace Managed like `https://<YourDynatraceServerURL>/e/<ENVIRONMENTID>/api` .\n\n### Advanced Options\n* **Disable Certificate Checking** - disable any certificate validation that may interact poorly with proxies with in your cluster\n* **Image Override** - use a copy of the ActiveGate container image from a registry other than Docker's or Red Hat's\n\nFor a complete list of supported parameters please consult the [Operator Deploy Guide](https://www.dynatrace.com/support/help/shortlink/openshift-deploy).\n\n### Help\nYou can find more about our instructions in our [documentation](https://www.dynatrace.com/support/help/shortlink/openshift-deploy#install-dynatrace-operator).\n",

Make sure you have a license and to obtain one, please contact Aqua Security at [Contact Us](mailto:cloudsales@aquasec.com).\n2. Create a new project for aqua\n\n    ```oc new-project aqua```\n\n3. Create the secret for Aqua Database password. If you are using an External Database, make sure you use those credentials.\nNOTE: This step is optional and you can specify the Database password when creating the CRs.\n\n    ```oc create secret generic aqua-database-password --from-literal=db-password=<password> -n aqua```\n\nPlease note that for the certified operator, the Docker registry secret is NOT needed. For the Red Hat certified operator, the Aqua application images are stored in the Red Hat Connect registry and will be automatically pulled by the Aqua operator.\n\n## Choosing the right channel\n\nChannels are a flexible publishing mechanism that offers you three different Aqua versions to deploy, at any point. These channels map to their respective Aqua versions, describing the maturity based on where they are in their lifecycle:\n* 4.6: This maps to the older version of Aqua 4.6.0\n* 5.0: This maps to the Aqua version 5.0.0\n* 5.3: This maps to the Aqua version 5.3.0\n* 6.0: This maps to the Aqua version 6.0.0\n* 6.2: This is the latest and greatest version of Aqua (default)\n\n## Deploying the Aqua Operator\n\nAqua Operator follows an easy push button deployment that installs the operator in its own aqua namespace.\nPlease refer to the instructions [here](https://github.com/aquasecurity/aqua-operator/blob/6.0.0/docs/DeployOpenShiftOperator.md).\n\n## Configuring the Aqua Operator\n\nOperators leverage CRDs as a configuration mechanism for the application. Aqua offers a number of CRDs that can be tweaked and configured as per your needs. Please refer to this [link](https://github.com/aquasecurity/aqua-operator/blob/6.0.0/docs/DeployOpenShiftOperator.md#aquacsp-crds) for Custom Resource examples for popular scenarios.\n\n## Support\n\nFor support please contact support@aquasec.com.",

      "csv_description": "The Dynatrace Operator supports rollout and lifecycle management of various Dynatrace components in Kubernetes and OpenShift.\n\nCurrently the Dynatrace Operator supports the following capabilities:\n\n### OneAgent\n  * `classicFullStack` rolls out one OneAgent pod per node to monitor its pods and the node itself\n  * `applicationMonitoring` is a webhook based injection mechanism for automatic app-only injection\n  * `hostMonitoring` monitors only the hosts, i.e., the nodes, in the cluster without app-only injection\n### ActiveGate\n  * `routing` routes OneAgent traffic through the ActiveGate\n  * `kubernetes-monitoring` allows monitoring the Kubernetes API\n  * `metrics-ingest` routes enriched metrics through an ActiveGate\n\nFor more information please refer to [our DynaKube Custom Resource examples](https://dt-url.net/dynakube-samples).\n\n### Installation\nOnce you've installed the Dynatrace Operator, you can create a DynaKube custom resource.\n\nFirst, please add a Secret within the Project you've deployed the Dynatrace Operator to, which would contain your API and PaaS tokens. Create tokens of type *Dynatrace API* (`API_TOKEN`) and *Platform as a Service* (`PAAS_TOKEN`) and use their values in the following commands respectively.\n\nFor assistance please refer to [Create user-generated access tokens](https://www.dynatrace.com/support/help/shortlink/token#create-user-generated-access-tokens).\n\n``` $ oc -n <project> create secret generic dynakube --from-literal=\"apiToken=API_TOKEN\" --from-literal=\"paasToken=PAAS_TOKEN\" ```\n\nYou may update this Secret at any time to rotate the tokens.\n\nAfter creation of the secret add the DynaKube object in the project where the Dynatrace Operator has been deployed, configured to your needs.\n\n### Required Parameters\n* `apiUrl` - provide the URL to the API of your Dynatrace environment. In Dynatrace SaaS it will look like `https://<ENVIRONMENTID>.live.dynatrace.com/api` . In Dynatrace Managed like `https://<YourDynatraceServerURL>/e/<ENVIRONMENTID>/api` .\n\n### Advanced Options\n* **Disable Certificate Checking** - disable any certificate validation that may interact poorly with proxies with in your cluster\n* **Image Override** - use a copy of the ActiveGate container image from a registry other than Docker's or Red Hat's\n\nFor a complete list of supported parameters please consult the [Operator Deploy Guide](https://www.dynatrace.com/support/help/shortlink/openshift-deploy).\n\n### Help\nYou can find more about our instructions in our [documentation](https://www.dynatrace.com/support/help/shortlink/openshift-deploy#install-dynatrace-operator).\n",

Make sure you have a license and to obtain one, please contact Aqua Security at [Contact Us](mailto:cloudsales@aquasec.com).\n2. Create a new project for aqua\n\n    ```oc new-project aqua```\n3. Create the secret for Aqua Database password\n\n    ```oc create secret generic aqua-database-password --from-literal=db-password=<password>```\n    \nPlease note that for the certified operator, the Docker registry secret is NOT needed. For the Red Hat certified operator, the Aqua application images are stored in the Red Hat Connect registry and will be automatically pulled by the Aqua operator.\n\n## Choosing the right channel\n\nChannels are a flexible publishing mechanism that offers you three different Aqua versions to deploy, at any point. These channels map to their respective Aqua versions, describing the maturity based on where they are in their lifecycle:\n* latest: This maps to the Aqua version 4.6.0\n* alpha: This maps to the Aqua version 5.0.0\n* 5.3: This is the latest and greatest version of Aqua (default)\n\n## Deploying the Aqua Operator\n\nAqua Operator follows an easy push button deployment that installs the operator in its own aqua namespace.\nPlease refer to the instructions [here](https://github.com/aquasecurity/aqua-operator/blob/5.3.0/docs/DeployOpenShiftOperator.md).\n\n## Configuring the Aqua Operator\n\nOperators leverage CRDs as a configuration mechanism for the application. Aqua offers a number of CRDs that can be tweaked and configured as per your needs. Please refer to this [link](https://github.com/aquasecurity/aqua-operator/blob/5.3.0/docs/DeployOpenShiftOperator.md#aquacsp-crds) for Custom Resource examples for popular scenarios.\n\n## Support\n\nFor support please contact support@aquasec.com.",
