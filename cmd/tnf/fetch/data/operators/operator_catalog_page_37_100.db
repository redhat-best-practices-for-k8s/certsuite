Kong Operator is a Kubernetes operator which manages [Kong](https://konghq.com/kong/) and [Kong Enterprise](https://konghq.com/products/kong-enterprise/) clusters.\n\nKong Operator can deploy Kong in various configurations, for example:\n* as a [Kubernetes ingress controller](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller), enabling you to expose Kubernetes `Service`s via Kong,\n* a standalone Kong gateway (without the ingress controller; either DB-enabled or DB-less)\n* a standalone Ingress Controller (configuring an external instance of Kong)\n\nThose configurations are further described in the [_Deployment Options_](https://github.com/Kong/kong-operator/blob/v0.10.1/helm-charts/kong/README.md#deployment-options) section of documentation.\n\n### Quick Start\n\nThe [Quick Start guide](https://github.com/Kong/kong-operator/blob/v0.10.1/README.md#quick-start) uses Kong Operator to deploy\nour recommended Kong setup for Kubernetes users (Kong DB-less with Ingress Controller), which includes an instance of Kong\nserving as a proxy to an example Kubernetes service.\n\n### Documentation\n\nThe primary documentation site for Kong Operator is located [in its GitHub repository](https://github.com/Kong/kong-operator/blob/v0.10.1/README.md).\n\nKong Operator provides the same configuration flexibility as the Kong Helm chart.\nRefer to the [Helm chart documentation](https://github.com/Kong/kong-operator/blob/v0.10.1/helm-charts/kong/README.md),\nthe [Configuration](https://github.com/Kong/kong-operator/blob/v0.10.1/README.md#configuration) section of Kong Operator docs, and the example `Kong` resource below.\n\n### Upgrading from versions 0.8.0 and earlier\n\n0.10.0 changes the operator CRD to comply with Kubernetes requirements. Upgrades require manual work to move configuration into the new CRs.\nSee the [0.10.0 upgrade guide](https://github.com/Kong/kong-operator/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md#upgrading-from-previous-versions)\nfor steps to upgrade past 0.8.0.\n",

Kong Operator is a Kubernetes operator which manages [Kong](https://konghq.com/kong/) and [Kong Enterprise](https://konghq.com/products/kong-enterprise/) clusters.\n\nKong Operator can deploy Kong in various configurations, for example:\n* as a [Kubernetes ingress controller](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller), enabling you to expose Kubernetes `Service`s via Kong,\n* a standalone Kong gateway (without the ingress controller; either DB-enabled or DB-less)\n* a standalone Ingress Controller (configuring an external instance of Kong)\n\nThose configurations are further described in the [_Deployment Options_](https://github.com/Kong/kong-operator/blob/v0.10.1/helm-charts/kong/README.md#deployment-options) section of documentation.\n\n### Quick Start\n\nThe [Quick Start guide](https://github.com/Kong/kong-operator/blob/v0.10.1/README.md#quick-start) uses Kong Operator to deploy\nour recommended Kong setup for Kubernetes users (Kong DB-less with Ingress Controller), which includes an instance of Kong\nserving as a proxy to an example Kubernetes service.\n\n### Documentation\n\nThe primary documentation site for Kong Operator is located [in its GitHub repository](https://github.com/Kong/kong-operator/blob/v0.10.1/README.md).\n\nKong Operator provides the same configuration flexibility as the Kong Helm chart.\nRefer to the [Helm chart documentation](https://github.com/Kong/kong-operator/blob/v0.10.1/helm-charts/kong/README.md),\nthe [Configuration](https://github.com/Kong/kong-operator/blob/v0.10.1/README.md#configuration) section of Kong Operator docs, and the example `Kong` resource below.\n\n### Upgrading from versions 0.8.0 and earlier\n\n0.10.0 changes the operator CRD to comply with Kubernetes requirements. Upgrades require manual work to move configuration into the new CRs.\nSee the [0.10.0 upgrade guide](https://github.com/Kong/kong-operator/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md#upgrading-from-previous-versions)\nfor steps to upgrade past 0.8.0.\n",

      "csv_description": "\n## Percona is Cloud Native\n\nPercona Operator for MySQL based on Percona XtraDB Cluster is an open-source drop in replacement for MySQL Enterprise with synchronous replication running on Kubernetes. It automates the deployment and management of the members in your Percona XtraDB Cluster environment. It can be used to instantiate a new Percona XtraDB Cluster, or to scale an existing environment.\n\nConsult the [documentation](https://percona.github.io/percona-xtradb-cluster-operator/) on the Percona Operator for MySQL based on Percona XtraDB Cluster for complete details on capabilities and options.\n\n### Supported Features\n\n* **Scale Your Cluster**  change the `size` parameter to [add or remove members](https://percona.github.io/percona-xtradb-cluster-operator/install/scaling) of the cluster. Three is the minimum recommended size for a functioning cluster.\n\n* **Manage Your Users**  [add, remove, or change](https://percona.github.io/percona-xtradb-cluster-operator/configure/users) the privileges of database users\n\n* **Automate Your Backups**  [configure cluster backups](https://percona.github.io/percona-xtradb-cluster-operator/configure/operator) to run on a scheduled basis. Backups can be stored on a persistent volume or S3-compatible storage. Leverage [Point-in-time recovery](https://www.percona.com/doc/kubernetes-operator-for-pxc/backups.html#storing-binary-logs-for-point-in-time-recovery) to reduce RPO/RTO.\n* **Proxy integration**  choose HAProxy or ProxySQL as a proxy in front of the Percona XtraDB Cluster. Proxies are deployed and configured automatically with the Operator.\n\n### Common Configurations\n\n* **Set Resource Limits** - set limitation on requests to CPU and memory resources.\n\n* **Customize Storage** - set the desired Storage Class and Access Mode for your database cluster data.\n\n* **Control Scheduling** - define how your PXC Pods are scheduled onto the K8S cluster with tolerations, pod disruption budgets, node selector and affinity settings.\n* Automatic synchronization of MySQL users with ProxySQL\n* HAProxy Support\n* Fully automated minor version updates (Smart Update)\n* Update Reader members before Writer member at cluster upgrades\n* Support MySQL versions 5.7 and 8.0\n### Before You Start\n\nAdd the PXC user `Secret` to Kubernetes. User information must be placed in the data section of the `secrets.yaml`\nfile with Base64-encoded logins and passwords for the user accounts.\n\nBelow is a sample `secrets.yaml` file for the correct formatting.\n\n```\napiVersion: v1\nkind: Secret\nmetadata:\n  name: my-cluster-secrets\ntype: Opaque\ndata:\n  root: cm9vdF9wYXNzd29yZA==\n  xtrabackup: YmFja3VwX3Bhc3N3b3Jk\n  monitor: bW9uaXRvcg==\n  clustercheck: Y2x1c3RlcmNoZWNrcGFzc3dvcmQ=\n  proxyadmin: YWRtaW5fcGFzc3dvcmQ=\n  pmmserver: c3VwYXxefHBheno=\n  operator: b3BlcmF0b3JhZG1pbg==\n  replication: cmVwbF9wYXNzd29yZAo=\n\n```\n###  Release Highlights\n* With this release, the Operator turns to a simplified naming convention and changes its official name to Percona Operator for MySQL based on Percona XtraDB Cluster * The new backup.backoffLimit Custom Resource option allows customizing the number of attempts the Operator should make for backup * The OpenAPI schema is now generated for the Operator CRD, which allows Kubernetes to validate Custom Resource and protects users from occasionally applying deploy/cr.yaml with syntax errors\n\n",

      "csv_description": "\n## Percona is Cloud Native\n\nPercona Operator for MySQL based on Percona XtraDB Cluster is an open-source drop in replacement for MySQL Enterprise with synchronous replication running on Kubernetes. It automates the deployment and management of the members in your Percona XtraDB Cluster environment. It can be used to instantiate a new Percona XtraDB Cluster, or to scale an existing environment.\n\nConsult the [documentation](https://percona.github.io/percona-xtradb-cluster-operator/) on the Percona Operator for MySQL based on Percona XtraDB Cluster for complete details on capabilities and options.\n\n### Supported Features\n\n* **Scale Your Cluster**  change the `size` parameter to [add or remove members](https://percona.github.io/percona-xtradb-cluster-operator/install/scaling) of the cluster. Three is the minimum recommended size for a functioning cluster.\n\n* **Manage Your Users**  [add, remove, or change](https://percona.github.io/percona-xtradb-cluster-operator/configure/users) the privileges of database users\n\n* **Automate Your Backups**  [configure cluster backups](https://percona.github.io/percona-xtradb-cluster-operator/configure/operator) to run on a scheduled basis. Backups can be stored on a persistent volume or S3-compatible storage. Leverage [Point-in-time recovery](https://www.percona.com/doc/kubernetes-operator-for-pxc/backups.html#storing-binary-logs-for-point-in-time-recovery) to reduce RPO/RTO.\n* **Proxy integration**  choose HAProxy or ProxySQL as a proxy in front of the Percona XtraDB Cluster. Proxies are deployed and configured automatically with the Operator.\n\n### Common Configurations\n\n* **Set Resource Limits** - set limitation on requests to CPU and memory resources.\n\n* **Customize Storage** - set the desired Storage Class and Access Mode for your database cluster data.\n\n* **Control Scheduling** - define how your PXC Pods are scheduled onto the K8S cluster with tolerations, pod disruption budgets, node selector and affinity settings.\n* Automatic synchronization of MySQL users with ProxySQL\n* HAProxy Support\n* Fully automated minor version updates (Smart Update)\n* Update Reader members before Writer member at cluster upgrades\n* Support MySQL versions 5.7 and 8.0\n### Before You Start\n\nAdd the PXC user `Secret` to Kubernetes. User information must be placed in the data section of the `secrets.yaml`\nfile with Base64-encoded logins and passwords for the user accounts.\n\nBelow is a sample `secrets.yaml` file for the correct formatting.\n\n```\napiVersion: v1\nkind: Secret\nmetadata:\n  name: my-cluster-secrets\ntype: Opaque\ndata:\n  root: cm9vdF9wYXNzd29yZA==\n  xtrabackup: YmFja3VwX3Bhc3N3b3Jk\n  monitor: bW9uaXRvcg==\n  clustercheck: Y2x1c3RlcmNoZWNrcGFzc3dvcmQ=\n  proxyadmin: YWRtaW5fcGFzc3dvcmQ=\n  pmmserver: c3VwYXxefHBheno=\n  operator: b3BlcmF0b3JhZG1pbg==\n  replication: cmVwbF9wYXNzd29yZAo=\n\n```\n###  Release Highlights\n* With this release, the Operator turns to a simplified naming convention and changes its official name to Percona Operator for MySQL based on Percona XtraDB Cluster * The new backup.backoffLimit Custom Resource option allows customizing the number of attempts the Operator should make for backup * The OpenAPI schema is now generated for the Operator CRD, which allows Kubernetes to validate Custom Resource and protects users from occasionally applying deploy/cr.yaml with syntax errors\n\n",

      "csv_description": "\n## Percona is Cloud Native\n\nPercona Operator for MySQL based on Percona XtraDB Cluster is an open-source drop in replacement for MySQL Enterprise with synchronous replication running on Kubernetes. It automates the deployment and management of the members in your Percona XtraDB Cluster environment. It can be used to instantiate a new Percona XtraDB Cluster, or to scale an existing environment.\n\nConsult the [documentation](https://percona.github.io/percona-xtradb-cluster-operator/) on the Percona Operator for MySQL based on Percona XtraDB Cluster for complete details on capabilities and options.\n\n### Supported Features\n\n* **Scale Your Cluster**  change the `size` parameter to [add or remove members](https://percona.github.io/percona-xtradb-cluster-operator/install/scaling) of the cluster. Three is the minimum recommended size for a functioning cluster.\n\n* **Manage Your Users**  [add, remove, or change](https://percona.github.io/percona-xtradb-cluster-operator/configure/users) the privileges of database users\n\n* **Automate Your Backups**  [configure cluster backups](https://percona.github.io/percona-xtradb-cluster-operator/configure/operator) to run on a scheduled basis. Backups can be stored on a persistent volume or S3-compatible storage. Leverage [Point-in-time recovery](https://www.percona.com/doc/kubernetes-operator-for-pxc/backups.html#storing-binary-logs-for-point-in-time-recovery) to reduce RPO/RTO.\n* **Proxy integration**  choose HAProxy or ProxySQL as a proxy in front of the Percona XtraDB Cluster. Proxies are deployed and configured automatically with the Operator.\n\n### Common Configurations\n\n* **Set Resource Limits** - set limitation on requests to CPU and memory resources.\n\n* **Customize Storage** - set the desired Storage Class and Access Mode for your database cluster data.\n\n* **Control Scheduling** - define how your PXC Pods are scheduled onto the K8S cluster with tolerations, pod disruption budgets, node selector and affinity settings.\n* Automatic synchronization of MySQL users with ProxySQL\n* HAProxy Support\n* Fully automated minor version updates (Smart Update)\n* Update Reader members before Writer member at cluster upgrades\n* Support MySQL versions 5.7 and 8.0\n### Before You Start\n\nAdd the PXC user `Secret` to Kubernetes. User information must be placed in the data section of the `secrets.yaml`\nfile with Base64-encoded logins and passwords for the user accounts.\n\nBelow is a sample `secrets.yaml` file for the correct formatting.\n\n```\napiVersion: v1\nkind: Secret\nmetadata:\n  name: my-cluster-secrets\ntype: Opaque\ndata:\n  root: cm9vdF9wYXNzd29yZA==\n  xtrabackup: YmFja3VwX3Bhc3N3b3Jk\n  monitor: bW9uaXRvcg==\n  clustercheck: Y2x1c3RlcmNoZWNrcGFzc3dvcmQ=\n  proxyadmin: YWRtaW5fcGFzc3dvcmQ=\n  pmmserver: c3VwYXxefHBheno=\n  operator: b3BlcmF0b3JhZG1pbg==\n  replication: cmVwbF9wYXNzd29yZAo=\n\n```\n###  Release Highlights\n* With this release, the Operator turns to a simplified naming convention and changes its official name to Percona Operator for MySQL based on Percona XtraDB Cluster * The new backup.backoffLimit Custom Resource option allows customizing the number of attempts the Operator should make for backup * The OpenAPI schema is now generated for the Operator CRD, which allows Kubernetes to validate Custom Resource and protects users from occasionally applying deploy/cr.yaml with syntax errors\n\n",

      "csv_description": "\n## Percona is Cloud Native\n\nPercona Operator for MySQL based on Percona XtraDB Cluster is an open-source drop in replacement for MySQL Enterprise with synchronous replication running on Kubernetes. It automates the deployment and management of the members in your Percona XtraDB Cluster environment. It can be used to instantiate a new Percona XtraDB Cluster, or to scale an existing environment.\n\nConsult the [documentation](https://percona.github.io/percona-xtradb-cluster-operator/) on the Percona Operator for MySQL based on Percona XtraDB Cluster for complete details on capabilities and options.\n\n### Supported Features\n\n* **Scale Your Cluster**  change the `size` parameter to [add or remove members](https://percona.github.io/percona-xtradb-cluster-operator/install/scaling) of the cluster. Three is the minimum recommended size for a functioning cluster.\n\n* **Manage Your Users**  [add, remove, or change](https://percona.github.io/percona-xtradb-cluster-operator/configure/users) the privileges of database users\n\n* **Automate Your Backups**  [configure cluster backups](https://percona.github.io/percona-xtradb-cluster-operator/configure/operator) to run on a scheduled basis. Backups can be stored on a persistent volume or S3-compatible storage. Leverage [Point-in-time recovery](https://www.percona.com/doc/kubernetes-operator-for-pxc/backups.html#storing-binary-logs-for-point-in-time-recovery) to reduce RPO/RTO.\n* **Proxy integration**  choose HAProxy or ProxySQL as a proxy in front of the Percona XtraDB Cluster. Proxies are deployed and configured automatically with the Operator.\n\n### Common Configurations\n\n* **Set Resource Limits** - set limitation on requests to CPU and memory resources.\n\n* **Customize Storage** - set the desired Storage Class and Access Mode for your database cluster data.\n\n* **Control Scheduling** - define how your PXC Pods are scheduled onto the K8S cluster with tolerations, pod disruption budgets, node selector and affinity settings.\n* Automatic synchronization of MySQL users with ProxySQL\n* HAProxy Support\n* Fully automated minor version updates (Smart Update)\n* Update Reader members before Writer member at cluster upgrades\n* Support MySQL versions 5.7 and 8.0\n### Before You Start\n\nAdd the PXC user `Secret` to Kubernetes. User information must be placed in the data section of the `secrets.yaml`\nfile with Base64-encoded logins and passwords for the user accounts.\n\nBelow is a sample `secrets.yaml` file for the correct formatting.\n\n```\napiVersion: v1\nkind: Secret\nmetadata:\n  name: my-cluster-secrets\ntype: Opaque\ndata:\n  root: cm9vdF9wYXNzd29yZA==\n  xtrabackup: YmFja3VwX3Bhc3N3b3Jk\n  monitor: bW9uaXRvcg==\n  clustercheck: Y2x1c3RlcmNoZWNrcGFzc3dvcmQ=\n  proxyadmin: YWRtaW5fcGFzc3dvcmQ=\n  pmmserver: c3VwYXxefHBheno=\n  operator: b3BlcmF0b3JhZG1pbg==\n  replication: cmVwbF9wYXNzd29yZAo=\n\n```\n###  Release Highlights\n* With this release, the Operator turns to a simplified naming convention and changes its official name to Percona Operator for MySQL based on Percona XtraDB Cluster * The new backup.backoffLimit Custom Resource option allows customizing the number of attempts the Operator should make for backup * The OpenAPI schema is now generated for the Operator CRD, which allows Kubernetes to validate Custom Resource and protects users from occasionally applying deploy/cr.yaml with syntax errors\n\n",

Replica sets provide redundancy and high\navailability, and are the basis for all production deployments. This section\nintroduces replication in MongoDB as well as the components and architecture\nof replica sets. The section also provides tutorials for common tasks\nrelated to replica sets.\n\n* Sharded Cluster: The set of nodes comprising a sharded MongoDB deployment.\nA sharded cluster consists of config servers, shards, and one or more mongos\nrouting processes. Sharding is a A database architecture that partitions\ndata by key ranges and distributes the data among two or more database\ninstances. Sharding enables horizontal scaling.\n\n## Requirements for deploying MongoDB OpsManager\n\n* In order to deploy resources of type MongoDB OpsManager, you will need to\ncreate a secret containing the [credentials](https://docs.mongodb.com/kubernetes-operator/stable/tutorial/plan-om-resource/#om-rsrc-prereqs)\nfor the Global Onwer user\n\n## Security ##\n\nThe operator can enable TLS for all traffic between servers and also between\nclients and servers. Before enabling `security.tls.enabled` to `true` you\nshould create your certificates.  or you can leave the operator to create all\nthe certificates for you. The operator ability to create certs is been\ndepricted due to Kuberentes API changes.\n\nFor more information, please read the official MongoDB\nKubernetes Operator  [docs](https://docs.mongodb.com/kubernetes-operator/stable/).\n",

      "csv_description": "The MongoDB Enterprise Kubernetes Operator enables easy deploys of MongoDB\ninto Kubernetes clusters, using our management, monitoring and backup\nplatforms, Ops Manager and Cloud Manager.\n\n## Before You Start\n\nTo start using the operator you''ll need an account in MongoDB Cloud Manager or\na MongoDB Ops Manager deployment.\n\n* [Create a Secret with your OpsManager API key](https://docs.mongodb.com/kubernetes-operator/stable/tutorial/create-operator-credentials/#procedure)\n\n* [Create a ConfigMap with your OpsManager project ID and URL](https://docs.mongodb.com/kubernetes-operator/stable/tutorial/create-project-using-configmap/)\n\nBy installing this integration, you will be able to deploy MongoDB instances\nwith a single simple command.\n\n## Required Parameters\n\n* `opsManager` or `cloudManager` - Enter the name of the ConfigMap containing project information\n* `credentials` - Enter the name of the Secret containing your OpsManager credentials\n* `type` - Enter MongoDB Deployment Types (\"Standalone\", \"ReplicaSet\", \"ShardedCluster\"\n\n## Supported MongoDB Deployment Types ##\n\n* Standalone: An instance of mongod that is running as a single server and\nnot as part of a replica set, this is, it does not do any kind of\nreplication.\n\n* Replica Set: A replica set in MongoDB is a group of mongod processes that\nmaintain the same data set. Replica sets provide redundancy and high\navailability, and are the basis for all production deployments. This section\nintroduces replication in MongoDB as well as the components and architecture\nof replica sets. The section also provides tutorials for common tasks\nrelated to replica sets.\n\n* Sharded Cluster: The set of nodes comprising a sharded MongoDB deployment.\nA sharded cluster consists of config servers, shards, and one or more mongos\nrouting processes. Sharding is a A database architecture that partitions\ndata by key ranges and distributes the data among two or more database\ninstances. Sharding enables horizontal scaling.\n\n## Requirements for deploying MongoDB OpsManager\n\n* In order to deploy resources of type MongoDB OpsManager, you will need to\ncreate a secret containing the [credentials](https://docs.mongodb.com/kubernetes-operator/stable/tutorial/plan-om-resource/#om-rsrc-prereqs)\nfor the Global Onwer user\n\n## Security ##\n\nThe operator can enable TLS for all traffic between servers and also between\nclients and servers. Before enabling `security.tls.enabled` to `true` you\nshould create your certificates.  or you can leave the operator to create all\nthe certificates for you. The operator ability to create certs is been\ndepricted due to Kuberentes API changes.\n\nFor more information, please read the official MongoDB\nKubernetes Operator  [docs](https://docs.mongodb.com/kubernetes-operator/stable/).\n",
