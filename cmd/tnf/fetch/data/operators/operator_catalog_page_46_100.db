The operator enables\ncontainers to transparently provision any amount of memory, enabling total\ncontainer memory capacity to exceed physical hardware limitations.\n\nUse the Kove External Memory operator to:\n\n* Create custom resources to automatically allocate memory to specific\n  containers\n* Increase container flexibility with dynamic memory capacity that\n  auto-grows as needed\n* Scale up container density by removing memory as an orchestration\n  bottleneck\n\n## Using the Operator\nUsing the operator is as simple as creating a custom resource which\nspecifies an initial Kove memory allocation size, a namespace, and a\ncontainer name. Containers in the specified namespace with a matching\ncontainer name will automatically be provided with a Kove memory allocation\nwhich will auto-grow as needed.\n\n## About Kove\nKove makes memory a provisionable resource, just like storage, CPUs, and\nnetworking. Kove External Memory provides a transparent, linearly scalable\nmemory resource accessible to any application without code changes, from\nbare-metal apps to virtual machines and containers.\n",

      "csv_description": "\n## Percona is Cloud Native\n\nPercona Operator for PostgreSQL automates and simplifies deploying and managing open source PostgreSQL clusters on Kubernetes. Percona Operator for PostgreSQL is based on Postgres Operator developed by Crunchy Data.\nWhether you need to get a simple PostgreSQL cluster up and running, need to deploy a high availability, fault tolerant cluster in production, or are running your own database-as-a-service, the Operator provides the essential features you need to keep your clusters healthy.\n\nConsult the [documentation](https://www.percona.com/doc/kubernetes-operator-for-postgresql/index.html) on the Percona Operator for PostgreSQL for complete details on capabilities and options.\n\n### Supported Features\n\n* **PostgreSQL Cluster Provisioning**\nCreate, Scale, & Delete PostgreSQL clusters with ease, while fully customizing your Pods and PostgreSQL configuration.\n* **High Availability**\n\n    Safe, automated failover backed by a distributed consensus based high-availability solution. Uses Pod Anti-Affinity to help resiliency; you can configure how much\n    enforced this can be. Failed primaries automatically heal, allowing for faster recovery time. Support for standby PostgreSQL clusters that work both within and\n    across multiple Kubernetes clusters.\n\n* **Disaster Recovery**\n\n    Backups and restores leverage the open source pgBackRest utility and includes support for full, incremental, and differential backups as well as efficient delta\n    restores. Set how long you want your backups retained for. Works great with very large databases!\n\n* **Communication Security**\n\n    Secure communication between your applications and data servers by enabling TLS for your PostgreSQL servers, including the ability to enforce all of your connections\n    to use TLS.\n\n* **Monitoring**\n\n    Track the health of your PostgreSQL clusters with Percona Monitoring and Management (PMM).\n\n* **PostgreSQL User Management**\n\n    Quickly add and remove users from your PostgreSQL clusters with powerful commands. Manage password expiration policies or use your preferred PostgreSQL authentication\n    scheme.\n\n* **Updates Management**\n\n    Safely apply PostgreSQL updates with minimal availability impact to your PostgreSQL clusters.\n\n* **Advanced Replication Support**\n\n    Choose between asynchronous replication and synchronous replication for workloads that are sensitive to losing transactions.\n\n* **Clone**\n\n    Create new clusters from your existing clusters or backups.\n\n* **Connection Pooling**\n\n    Use [pgBouncer](https://access.crunchydata.com/documentation/postgres-operator/latest/tutorial/pgbouncer/) for connection pooling\n\n* **Affinity and Tolerations**\n\n    Have your PostgreSQL clusters deployed to Kubernetes Nodes of your preference with node affinity, or designate which nodes Kubernetes can schedule PostgreSQL instances\n    to with Kubernetes  tolerations.\n\n* **Scheduled Backups**\n\n    Choose the type of backup (full, incremental, differential) and how frequently you want it to occur on each PostgreSQL cluster.\n\n* **Backup to S3**\n\n    Store your backups in Amazon S3 or any object storage system that supports the S3 protocol. The Operator can backup, restore, and create new clusters from these backups.\n\n* **Multi-Namespace Support**\n\n    You can control how the Operator leverages Kubernetes Namespaces with several different deployment models:\n\n    * Deploy the Operator and all PostgreSQL clusters to the same namespace\n    * Deploy the Operator to one Namespace, and all PostgreSQL clusters to a different Namespace\n    * Deploy the Operator to one Namespace, and have your PostgreSQL clusters managed across multiple Namespaces\n\n* **Full Customizability**\n\n    The Operator not only makes it easy to get PostgreSQL up and running on Kubernetes-enabled platforms, but also allows you to further customize your deployments:\n\n    * Selecting different storage classes for your primary, replica, and backup storage\n    * Select your own container resources class for each PostgreSQL cluster deployment; differentiate between resources applied for primary and replica clusters\n    * Use your own container image repository, including `imagePullSecrets` and private repositories  support\n    * Customize your PostgreSQL configuration\n    * Bring your own trusted certificate authority (CA) for use with the Operator API server\n    * Override your PostgreSQL configuration for each cluster\n    * Use your own custom images, re-define the image for each container separately\n\n### Release highlights\n* **What's new**\n\n    * The automated upgrade is now disabled by default to prevent an unplanned downtimes for user applications and to provide defaults more focused on strict user\u2019s control over the cluster\n    * Flexible anti-affinity configuration is now available, which allows the Operator to isolate PostgreSQL cluster instances on different Kubernetes nodes or to increase its availability by placing\nPostgreSQL instances in different availability zones\n    * Add possibility for postgres user to connect to PostgreSQL through PgBouncer with a new pgBouncer.exposePostgresUser Custom Resource option\n    * A new build and testing guide allows user to easily experiment with the source code of the Operator\n    * Fix the bug in the instruction on passing custom configuration options for PostgreSQL which made it usable for the new cluster only\n    * Fix the bug which caused the Operator crash without pgReplicas section in Custom Resource definition\n    * Fix the bug which caused the Operator to make connection requests to Version Service even with disabled Smart Update\n    * Fix the bug due to which restoring S3 backup from storage with self-signed certificates didn\u2019t work, by introducing the special backup.storages.verifyTLS option to address this issue\n",

      "csv_description": "\n## Percona is Cloud Native\n\nPercona Operator for PostgreSQL automates and simplifies deploying and managing open source PostgreSQL clusters on Kubernetes. Percona Operator for PostgreSQL is based on Postgres Operator developed by Crunchy Data.\nWhether you need to get a simple PostgreSQL cluster up and running, need to deploy a high availability, fault tolerant cluster in production, or are running your own database-as-a-service, the Operator provides the essential features you need to keep your clusters healthy.\n\nConsult the [documentation](https://www.percona.com/doc/kubernetes-operator-for-postgresql/index.html) on the Percona Operator for PostgreSQL for complete details on capabilities and options.\n\n### Supported Features\n\n* **PostgreSQL Cluster Provisioning**\nCreate, Scale, & Delete PostgreSQL clusters with ease, while fully customizing your Pods and PostgreSQL configuration.\n* **High Availability**\n\n    Safe, automated failover backed by a distributed consensus based high-availability solution. Uses Pod Anti-Affinity to help resiliency; you can configure how much\n    enforced this can be. Failed primaries automatically heal, allowing for faster recovery time. Support for standby PostgreSQL clusters that work both within and\n    across multiple Kubernetes clusters.\n\n* **Disaster Recovery**\n\n    Backups and restores leverage the open source pgBackRest utility and includes support for full, incremental, and differential backups as well as efficient delta\n    restores. Set how long you want your backups retained for. Works great with very large databases!\n\n* **Communication Security**\n\n    Secure communication between your applications and data servers by enabling TLS for your PostgreSQL servers, including the ability to enforce all of your connections\n    to use TLS.\n\n* **Monitoring**\n\n    Track the health of your PostgreSQL clusters with Percona Monitoring and Management (PMM).\n\n* **PostgreSQL User Management**\n\n    Quickly add and remove users from your PostgreSQL clusters with powerful commands. Manage password expiration policies or use your preferred PostgreSQL authentication\n    scheme.\n\n* **Updates Management**\n\n    Safely apply PostgreSQL updates with minimal availability impact to your PostgreSQL clusters.\n\n* **Advanced Replication Support**\n\n    Choose between asynchronous replication and synchronous replication for workloads that are sensitive to losing transactions.\n\n* **Clone**\n\n    Create new clusters from your existing clusters or backups.\n\n* **Connection Pooling**\n\n    Use [pgBouncer](https://access.crunchydata.com/documentation/postgres-operator/latest/tutorial/pgbouncer/) for connection pooling\n\n* **Affinity and Tolerations**\n\n    Have your PostgreSQL clusters deployed to Kubernetes Nodes of your preference with node affinity, or designate which nodes Kubernetes can schedule PostgreSQL instances\n    to with Kubernetes  tolerations.\n\n* **Scheduled Backups**\n\n    Choose the type of backup (full, incremental, differential) and how frequently you want it to occur on each PostgreSQL cluster.\n\n* **Backup to S3**\n\n    Store your backups in Amazon S3 or any object storage system that supports the S3 protocol. The Operator can backup, restore, and create new clusters from these backups.\n\n* **Multi-Namespace Support**\n\n    You can control how the Operator leverages Kubernetes Namespaces with several different deployment models:\n\n    * Deploy the Operator and all PostgreSQL clusters to the same namespace\n    * Deploy the Operator to one Namespace, and all PostgreSQL clusters to a different Namespace\n    * Deploy the Operator to one Namespace, and have your PostgreSQL clusters managed across multiple Namespaces\n\n* **Full Customizability**\n\n    The Operator not only makes it easy to get PostgreSQL up and running on Kubernetes-enabled platforms, but also allows you to further customize your deployments:\n\n    * Selecting different storage classes for your primary, replica, and backup storage\n    * Select your own container resources class for each PostgreSQL cluster deployment; differentiate between resources applied for primary and replica clusters\n    * Use your own container image repository, including `imagePullSecrets` and private repositories  support\n    * Customize your PostgreSQL configuration\n    * Bring your own trusted certificate authority (CA) for use with the Operator API server\n    * Override your PostgreSQL configuration for each cluster\n    * Use your own custom images, re-define the image for each container separately\n\n### Release highlights\n* **What's new**\n\n    * The automated upgrade is now disabled by default to prevent an unplanned downtimes for user applications and to provide defaults more focused on strict user\u2019s control over the cluster\n    * Flexible anti-affinity configuration is now available, which allows the Operator to isolate PostgreSQL cluster instances on different Kubernetes nodes or to increase its availability by placing\nPostgreSQL instances in different availability zones\n    * Add possibility for postgres user to connect to PostgreSQL through PgBouncer with a new pgBouncer.exposePostgresUser Custom Resource option\n    * A new build and testing guide allows user to easily experiment with the source code of the Operator\n    * Fix the bug in the instruction on passing custom configuration options for PostgreSQL which made it usable for the new cluster only\n    * Fix the bug which caused the Operator crash without pgReplicas section in Custom Resource definition\n    * Fix the bug which caused the Operator to make connection requests to Version Service even with disabled Smart Update\n    * Fix the bug due to which restoring S3 backup from storage with self-signed certificates didn\u2019t work, by introducing the special backup.storages.verifyTLS option to address this issue\n",

      "csv_description": "\n## Percona is Cloud Native\n\nPercona Operator for PostgreSQL automates and simplifies deploying and managing open source PostgreSQL clusters on Kubernetes. Percona Operator for PostgreSQL is based on Postgres Operator developed by Crunchy Data.\nWhether you need to get a simple PostgreSQL cluster up and running, need to deploy a high availability, fault tolerant cluster in production, or are running your own database-as-a-service, the Operator provides the essential features you need to keep your clusters healthy.\n\nConsult the [documentation](https://www.percona.com/doc/kubernetes-operator-for-postgresql/index.html) on the Percona Operator for PostgreSQL for complete details on capabilities and options.\n\n### Supported Features\n\n* **PostgreSQL Cluster Provisioning**\nCreate, Scale, & Delete PostgreSQL clusters with ease, while fully customizing your Pods and PostgreSQL configuration.\n* **High Availability**\n\n    Safe, automated failover backed by a distributed consensus based high-availability solution. Uses Pod Anti-Affinity to help resiliency; you can configure how much\n    enforced this can be. Failed primaries automatically heal, allowing for faster recovery time. Support for standby PostgreSQL clusters that work both within and\n    across multiple Kubernetes clusters.\n\n* **Disaster Recovery**\n\n    Backups and restores leverage the open source pgBackRest utility and includes support for full, incremental, and differential backups as well as efficient delta\n    restores. Set how long you want your backups retained for. Works great with very large databases!\n\n* **Communication Security**\n\n    Secure communication between your applications and data servers by enabling TLS for your PostgreSQL servers, including the ability to enforce all of your connections\n    to use TLS.\n\n* **Monitoring**\n\n    Track the health of your PostgreSQL clusters with Percona Monitoring and Management (PMM).\n\n* **PostgreSQL User Management**\n\n    Quickly add and remove users from your PostgreSQL clusters with powerful commands. Manage password expiration policies or use your preferred PostgreSQL authentication\n    scheme.\n\n* **Updates Management**\n\n    Safely apply PostgreSQL updates with minimal availability impact to your PostgreSQL clusters.\n\n* **Advanced Replication Support**\n\n    Choose between asynchronous replication and synchronous replication for workloads that are sensitive to losing transactions.\n\n* **Clone**\n\n    Create new clusters from your existing clusters or backups.\n\n* **Connection Pooling**\n\n    Use [pgBouncer](https://access.crunchydata.com/documentation/postgres-operator/latest/tutorial/pgbouncer/) for connection pooling\n\n* **Affinity and Tolerations**\n\n    Have your PostgreSQL clusters deployed to Kubernetes Nodes of your preference with node affinity, or designate which nodes Kubernetes can schedule PostgreSQL instances\n    to with Kubernetes  tolerations.\n\n* **Scheduled Backups**\n\n    Choose the type of backup (full, incremental, differential) and how frequently you want it to occur on each PostgreSQL cluster.\n\n* **Backup to S3**\n\n    Store your backups in Amazon S3 or any object storage system that supports the S3 protocol. The Operator can backup, restore, and create new clusters from these backups.\n\n* **Multi-Namespace Support**\n\n    You can control how the Operator leverages Kubernetes Namespaces with several different deployment models:\n\n    * Deploy the Operator and all PostgreSQL clusters to the same namespace\n    * Deploy the Operator to one Namespace, and all PostgreSQL clusters to a different Namespace\n    * Deploy the Operator to one Namespace, and have your PostgreSQL clusters managed across multiple Namespaces\n\n* **Full Customizability**\n\n    The Operator not only makes it easy to get PostgreSQL up and running on Kubernetes-enabled platforms, but also allows you to further customize your deployments:\n\n    * Selecting different storage classes for your primary, replica, and backup storage\n    * Select your own container resources class for each PostgreSQL cluster deployment; differentiate between resources applied for primary and replica clusters\n    * Use your own container image repository, including `imagePullSecrets` and private repositories  support\n    * Customize your PostgreSQL configuration\n    * Bring your own trusted certificate authority (CA) for use with the Operator API server\n    * Override your PostgreSQL configuration for each cluster\n    * Use your own custom images, re-define the image for each container separately\n\n### Release highlights\n* **What's new**\n\n    * The automated upgrade is now disabled by default to prevent an unplanned downtimes for user applications and to provide defaults more focused on strict user\u2019s control over the cluster\n    * Flexible anti-affinity configuration is now available, which allows the Operator to isolate PostgreSQL cluster instances on different Kubernetes nodes or to increase its availability by placing\nPostgreSQL instances in different availability zones\n    * Add possibility for postgres user to connect to PostgreSQL through PgBouncer with a new pgBouncer.exposePostgresUser Custom Resource option\n    * A new build and testing guide allows user to easily experiment with the source code of the Operator\n    * Fix the bug in the instruction on passing custom configuration options for PostgreSQL which made it usable for the new cluster only\n    * Fix the bug which caused the Operator crash without pgReplicas section in Custom Resource definition\n    * Fix the bug which caused the Operator to make connection requests to Version Service even with disabled Smart Update\n    * Fix the bug due to which restoring S3 backup from storage with self-signed certificates didn\u2019t work, by introducing the special backup.storages.verifyTLS option to address this issue\n",

      "csv_description": "\n## Percona is Cloud Native\n\nPercona Operator for PostgreSQL automates and simplifies deploying and managing open source PostgreSQL clusters on Kubernetes. Percona Operator for PostgreSQL is based on Postgres Operator developed by Crunchy Data.\nWhether you need to get a simple PostgreSQL cluster up and running, need to deploy a high availability, fault tolerant cluster in production, or are running your own database-as-a-service, the Operator provides the essential features you need to keep your clusters healthy.\n\nConsult the [documentation](https://www.percona.com/doc/kubernetes-operator-for-postgresql/index.html) on the Percona Operator for PostgreSQL for complete details on capabilities and options.\n\n### Supported Features\n\n* **PostgreSQL Cluster Provisioning**\nCreate, Scale, & Delete PostgreSQL clusters with ease, while fully customizing your Pods and PostgreSQL configuration.\n* **High Availability**\n\n    Safe, automated failover backed by a distributed consensus based high-availability solution. Uses Pod Anti-Affinity to help resiliency; you can configure how much\n    enforced this can be. Failed primaries automatically heal, allowing for faster recovery time. Support for standby PostgreSQL clusters that work both within and\n    across multiple Kubernetes clusters.\n\n* **Disaster Recovery**\n\n    Backups and restores leverage the open source pgBackRest utility and includes support for full, incremental, and differential backups as well as efficient delta\n    restores. Set how long you want your backups retained for. Works great with very large databases!\n\n* **Communication Security**\n\n    Secure communication between your applications and data servers by enabling TLS for your PostgreSQL servers, including the ability to enforce all of your connections\n    to use TLS.\n\n* **Monitoring**\n\n    Track the health of your PostgreSQL clusters with Percona Monitoring and Management (PMM).\n\n* **PostgreSQL User Management**\n\n    Quickly add and remove users from your PostgreSQL clusters with powerful commands. Manage password expiration policies or use your preferred PostgreSQL authentication\n    scheme.\n\n* **Updates Management**\n\n    Safely apply PostgreSQL updates with minimal availability impact to your PostgreSQL clusters.\n\n* **Advanced Replication Support**\n\n    Choose between asynchronous replication and synchronous replication for workloads that are sensitive to losing transactions.\n\n* **Clone**\n\n    Create new clusters from your existing clusters or backups.\n\n* **Connection Pooling**\n\n    Use [pgBouncer](https://access.crunchydata.com/documentation/postgres-operator/latest/tutorial/pgbouncer/) for connection pooling\n\n* **Affinity and Tolerations**\n\n    Have your PostgreSQL clusters deployed to Kubernetes Nodes of your preference with node affinity, or designate which nodes Kubernetes can schedule PostgreSQL instances\n    to with Kubernetes  tolerations.\n\n* **Scheduled Backups**\n\n    Choose the type of backup (full, incremental, differential) and how frequently you want it to occur on each PostgreSQL cluster.\n\n* **Backup to S3**\n\n    Store your backups in Amazon S3 or any object storage system that supports the S3 protocol. The Operator can backup, restore, and create new clusters from these backups.\n\n* **Multi-Namespace Support**\n\n    You can control how the Operator leverages Kubernetes Namespaces with several different deployment models:\n\n    * Deploy the Operator and all PostgreSQL clusters to the same namespace\n    * Deploy the Operator to one Namespace, and all PostgreSQL clusters to a different Namespace\n    * Deploy the Operator to one Namespace, and have your PostgreSQL clusters managed across multiple Namespaces\n\n* **Full Customizability**\n\n    The Operator not only makes it easy to get PostgreSQL up and running on Kubernetes-enabled platforms, but also allows you to further customize your deployments:\n\n    * Selecting different storage classes for your primary, replica, and backup storage\n    * Select your own container resources class for each PostgreSQL cluster deployment; differentiate between resources applied for primary and replica clusters\n    * Use your own container image repository, including `imagePullSecrets` and private repositories  support\n    * Customize your PostgreSQL configuration\n    * Bring your own trusted certificate authority (CA) for use with the Operator API server\n    * Override your PostgreSQL configuration for each cluster\n    * Use your own custom images, re-define the image for each container separately\n\n### Release highlights\n* **What's new**\n\n    * The automated upgrade is now disabled by default to prevent an unplanned downtimes for user applications and to provide defaults more focused on strict user\u2019s control over the cluster\n    * Flexible anti-affinity configuration is now available, which allows the Operator to isolate PostgreSQL cluster instances on different Kubernetes nodes or to increase its availability by placing\nPostgreSQL instances in different availability zones\n    * Add possibility for postgres user to connect to PostgreSQL through PgBouncer with a new pgBouncer.exposePostgresUser Custom Resource option\n    * A new build and testing guide allows user to easily experiment with the source code of the Operator\n    * Fix the bug in the instruction on passing custom configuration options for PostgreSQL which made it usable for the new cluster only\n    * Fix the bug which caused the Operator crash without pgReplicas section in Custom Resource definition\n    * Fix the bug which caused the Operator to make connection requests to Version Service even with disabled Smart Update\n    * Fix the bug due to which restoring S3 backup from storage with self-signed certificates didn\u2019t work, by introducing the special backup.storages.verifyTLS option to address this issue\n",

      "csv_description": "# Getting Started with the Splunk Operator for Kubernetes\nThe Splunk Operator for Kubernetes enables you to quickly and easily deploy Splunk Enterprise on your choice of private or public cloud provider. The Operator simplifies scaling and management of Splunk Enterprise by automating administrative workflows using Kubernetes best practices. \n\nThe Splunk Operator runs as a container, and uses the Kubernetes [operator pattern](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/operator/) and [custom resources](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/api-extension/custom-resources/) objects to create and manage a scalable and sustainable Splunk Enterprise environment.\n\nThis guide is intended to help new users get up and running with the\nSplunk Operator for Kubernetes. It is divided into the following sections:\n\n* [Known Issues for the Splunk Operator](#known-issues-for-the-splunk-operator)\n* [Prerequisites for the Splunk Operator](#prerequisites-for-the-splunk-operator)\n* [Installing the Splunk Operator](#installing-the-splunk-operator)\n* [Creating Splunk Enterprise Deployments](#creating-a-splunk-enterprise-deployment)\n* [Securing Splunk Deployments in Kubernetes](Security.md)\n* [Contacting Support](#contacting-support)\n\n## Support Resources\n\nSPLUNK SUPPORTED: The Splunk Operator for Kubernetes is a supported method for deploying distributed Splunk Enterprise environments using containers.\n\nCOMMUNITY DEVELOPED: Splunk Operator for Kubernetes is an open source product developed by Splunkers with contributions from the community of partners and customers. The primary reason why Splunk is taking this approach is to push product development closer to those that use and depend upon it. This direct connection will help us all be more successful and move at a rapid pace.\n\nIf you're interested in contributing to the SOK open source project, review the [Contributing to the Project](CONTRIBUTING.md) page.\n\n**Community Support & Discussions on\n[Slack](https://splunk-usergroups.slack.com)** channel #splunk-operator-for-kubernetes\n\n**File Issues or Enhancements in\n[GitHub](https://github.com/splunk/splunk-operator/issues)** splunk/splunk-operator\n\n\n## Known Issues for the Splunk Operator\n\nReview the [Change Log](ChangeLog.md) page for a history of changes in each release.\n\n## Prerequisites for the Splunk Operator\n\n### Supported Kubernetes Versions\n\n- Kubernetes, version 1.16.2+ and later (x86 64-bit only).\n\nThe Splunk Operator should work with any [CNCF certified distribution](https://www.cncf.io/certification/software-conformance/) of Kubernetes. We do not have platform recommendations, but this is a table of platforms that our developers, customers, and partners have used successfully with the Splunk Operator.\n\n<table>\n<tr><td> Splunk Development & Testing Platforms </td><td> Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS), Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) </td></tr>\n<tr><td> Customer Reported Platforms </td><td> Microsoft Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), Red Hat OpenShift </td></tr>\n<tr><td> Partner Tested Platforms</td><td> HPE Ezmeral</td></tr>\n<tr><td> Other Platforms </td><td>CNCF certified distribution</td></tr>\n</table>\n\n### Splunk Enterprise Compatibility\nEach Splunk Operator release has specific Splunk Enterprise compatibility requirements. Before installing or upgrading the Splunk Operator, review the [Change Log](ChangeLog.md) to verify version compatibility with Splunk Enterprise releases.\n\n### Splunk Apps Installation\n\nApps and add-ons can be installed using the Splunk Operator by following the instructions given at [Installing Splunk Apps](Examples.md#installing-splunk-apps).  Premium apps such as Enterprise Security and IT Service Intelligence are currently not supported.\n\n\n### Docker requirements\nThe Splunk Operator requires these docker images to be present or available to your Kubernetes cluster:\n\n* `splunk/splunk-operator`: The Splunk Operator image built by this repository or the [official release](https://hub.docker.com/r/splunk/splunk-operator) (2.0.0 or later)\n* `splunk/splunk:<version>`: The [Splunk Enterprise image](https://github.com/splunk/docker-splunk) (9.0.0 or later)\n\nAll of the Splunk Enterprise images are publicly available on [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/). If your cluster does not have access to pull from Docker Hub, see the [Required Images Documentation](Images.md) page.\n\nReview the [Change Log](ChangeLog.md) page for a history of changes and Splunk Enterprise compatibility for each release.\n\n### Hardware Resources Requirements\nThe resource guidelines for running production Splunk Enterprise instances in pods through the Splunk Operator are the same as running Splunk Enterprise natively on a supported operating system and file system. Refer to the Splunk Enterprise [Reference Hardware documentation](https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/latest/Capacity/Referencehardware) for additional details.  We would also recommend following the same guidance on [Splunk Enterprise for disabling Transparent Huge Pages (THP)](https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/latest/ReleaseNotes/SplunkandTHP) for the nodes in your Kubernetes cluster.  Please be aware that this may impact performance of other non-Splunk workloads.\n\n#### Minimum Reference Hardware\nBased on Splunk Enterprise [Reference Hardware documentation](https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/latest/Capacity/Referencehardware), a summary of the minimum reference hardware requirements is given below.\n\n| Standalone        | Search Head / Search Head Cluster | Indexer Cluster |\n| ---------- | ------- | ------- |\n| _Each Standalone Pod: 12 Physical CPU Cores or 24 vCPU at 2Ghz or greater per core, 12GB RAM._| _Each Search Head Pod: 16 Physical CPU Cores or 32 vCPU at 2Ghz or greater per core, 12GB RAM._| _Each Indexer Pod: 12 Physical CPU cores, or 24 vCPU at 2GHz or greater per core, 12GB RAM._ |\n\n\n#### _Using Kubernetes Quality of Service Classes_\n\nIn addition to the guidelines provided in the reference hardware, [Kubernetes Quality of Service Classes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/quality-service-pod/)  can be used to configure CPU/Mem resources allocations that map to your _service level objectives_. For further information on utilizing Kubernetes Quality of Service (QoS) classes, see the table below:\n\n\n| QoS        | Summary| Description |\n| ---------- | ------- | ------- |\n| _Guaranteed_ | _CPU/Mem ```requests``` = CPU/Mem ```limits```_    | _When the CPU and memory  ```requests``` and ```limits``` values are equal, the pod is given a QoS class of Guaranteed. This level of service is recommended for Splunk Enterprise ___production environments___._ |\n| _Burstable_ | _CPU/Mem ```requests``` < CPU/Mem ```limits```_  | _When the CPU and memory  ```requests``` value is set lower than the ```limits``` the pod is given a QoS class of Burstable. This level of service is useful in a user acceptance testing ___(UAT) environment___, where the pods run with minimum resources, and Kubernetes allocates additional resources depending on usage._|\n| _BestEffort_ | _No CPU/Mem ```requests``` or ```limits``` are set_ | _When the ```requests``` or ```limits``` values are not set, the pod is given a QoS class of BestEffort. This level of service is sufficient for ___testing, or a small development task___._ |\n\nExamples on how to implement these QoS are given at [Examples of Guaranteed and Burstable QoS](CustomResources.md#examples-of-guaranteed-and-burstable-qos) section.\n\n\n### Storage guidelines\nThe Splunk Operator uses Kubernetes [Persistent Volume Claims](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/persistent-volumes/#persistentvolumeclaims) to store all of your Splunk Enterprise configuration (\"$SPLUNK_HOME/etc\" path) and event (\"$SPLUNK_HOME/var\" path) data. If one of the underlying machines fail, Kubernetes will automatically try to recover by restarting the Splunk Enterprise pods on another machine that is able to reuse the same data volumes. This minimizes the maintenance burden on your operations team by reducing the impact of common hardware failures to the equivalent of a service restart. \nThe use of Persistent Volume Claims requires that your cluster is configured to support one or more Kubernetes persistent [Storage Classes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/storage-classes/). See the [Setting Up a Persistent Storage for Splunk](StorageClass.md) page for more\ninformation.\n\n### What Storage Type To Use?\n\nThe Kubernetes infrastructure must have access to storage that meets or exceeds the recommendations provided in the Splunk Enterprise storage type recommendations at [Reference Hardware documentation - what storage type to use for a given role?](https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/latest/Capacity/Referencehardware#What_storage_type_should_I_use_for_a_role.3F) In summary, Indexers with SmartStore need NVMe or SSD storage to provide the necessary IOPs for a successful Splunk Enterprise environment.\n\n\n### Splunk SmartStore Required\nFor production environments, we are requiring the use of Splunk SmartStore. As a Splunk Enterprise deployment's data volume increases, demand for storage typically outpaces demand for compute resources. [Splunk's SmartStore Feature](https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/latest/Indexer/AboutSmartStore) allows you to manage your indexer storage and compute resources in a ___cost-effective___ manner by scaling those resources separately. SmartStore utilizes a fast storage cache on each indexer node to keep recent data locally available for search and keep other data in a remote object store. Look into the [SmartStore Resource Guide](SmartStore.md) document for configuring and using SmartStore through operator.\n\n## Installing the Splunk Operator\n\nA Kubernetes cluster administrator can install and start the Splunk Operator for specific namespace by running:\n```\nkubectl apply -f https://github.com/splunk/splunk-operator/releases/download/2.0.0/splunk-operator-namespace.yaml\n```\n\nA Kubernetes cluster administrator can install and start the Splunk Operator for cluster-wide by running:\n```\nkubectl apply -f https://github.com/splunk/splunk-operator/releases/download/2.0.0/splunk-operator-cluster.yaml\n```\n\nThe [Advanced Installation Instructions](Install.md) page offers guidance for advanced configurations, including the use of private image registries, installation at cluster scope, and installing the Splunk Operator as a user who is not a Kubernetes administrator. Users of Red Hat OpenShift should review the [Red Hat OpenShift](OpenShift.md) page.\n\nThe [Advanced Installation Instructions](Install.md) page offers guidance for advanced configurations, including the use of private image registries, installation at cluster scope, and installing the Splunk Operator as a user who is not a Kubernetes administrator. Users of Red Hat OpenShift should review the [Red Hat OpenShift](OpenShift.md) page.\n\n*Note: We recommended that the Splunk Enterprise Docker image is copied to a private registry, or directly onto your Kubernetes workers before creating large Splunk Enterprise deployments. See the [Required Images Documentation](Images.md) page, and the [Advanced Installation Instructions](Install.md) page for guidance on working with copies of the Docker images.*\n\nAfter the Splunk Operator starts, you'll see a single pod running within your current namespace:\n```\n$ kubectl get pods\nNAME                               READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE\nsplunk-operator-75f5d4d85b-8pshn   1/1     Running   0          5s\n```\n## Upgrading the Splunk Operator\n\nFor information on upgrading the Splunk Operator, see the [How to upgrade Splunk Operator and Splunk Enterprise Deployments](SplunkOperatorUpgrade.md) page.\n\n## Creating a Splunk Enterprise deployment\n\nThe `Standalone` custom resource is used to create a single instance deployment of Splunk Enterprise. For example:\n\n1. Run the command to create a deployment named \u201cs1\u201d:\n\n\n```yaml\ncat <<EOF | kubectl apply -n splunk-operator -f -\napiVersion: enterprise.splunk.com/v3\nkind: Standalone\nmetadata:\n  name: s1\n  finalizers:\n  - enterprise.splunk.com/delete-pvc\nEOF\n```\n\n**The `enterprise.splunk.com/delete-pvc` finalizer is optional, and tells the Splunk Operator to remove any Kubernetes [Persistent Volumes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/persistent-volumes/) associated with the instance if you delete the pod.**\n\nWithin a few minutes, you'll see new pods running in your namespace:\n\n```\n$ kubectl get pods\nNAME                                   READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE\nsplunk-operator-7c5599546c-wt4xl        1/1    Running   0          11h\nsplunk-s1-standalone-0                  1/1    Running   0          45s\n```\n\n*Note: if your shell prints a `%` at the end, leave that out when you copy the output.*\n\n2. You can use a simple network port forward to open port 8000 for Splunk Web access:\n\n```\nkubectl port-forward splunk-s1-standalone-0 8000\n```\n\n3. Get your passwords for the namespace. The Splunk Enterprise passwords used in the namespace are generated automatically. To learn how to find and read the passwords, see the [Reading global kubernetes secret object](Examples.md#reading-global-kubernetes-secret-object) page.\n\n\n4. Log into Splunk Enterprise at http://localhost:8000 using the `admin` account with the password.\n\n5. To delete your standalone deployment, run:\n\n```\nkubectl delete standalone s1\n``` \n\nThe `Standalone` custom resource is just one of the resources the Splunk Operator provides. You can find more custom resources and the parameters they support on the [Custom Resource Guide](CustomResources.md) page.\n\nFor additional deployment examples, including Splunk Enterprise clusters, see the \n[Configuring Splunk Enterprise Deployments](Examples.md) page.\n\nFor additional guidance on making Splunk Enterprise ports accessible outside of Kubernetes, see the [Configuring Ingress](Ingress.md) page.\n\n## Contacting Support\nIf you are a Splunk Enterprise customer with a valid support entitlement contract and have a Splunk-related question, you can open a support case on the https://www.splunk.com/ support portal.\"\n",

      "csv_description": "# Getting Started with the Splunk Operator for Kubernetes\nThe Splunk Operator for Kubernetes enables you to quickly and easily deploy Splunk Enterprise on your choice of private or public cloud provider. The Operator simplifies scaling and management of Splunk Enterprise by automating administrative workflows using Kubernetes best practices. \n\nThe Splunk Operator runs as a container, and uses the Kubernetes [operator pattern](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/operator/) and [custom resources](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/api-extension/custom-resources/) objects to create and manage a scalable and sustainable Splunk Enterprise environment.\n\nThis guide is intended to help new users get up and running with the\nSplunk Operator for Kubernetes. It is divided into the following sections:\n\n* [Known Issues for the Splunk Operator](#known-issues-for-the-splunk-operator)\n* [Prerequisites for the Splunk Operator](#prerequisites-for-the-splunk-operator)\n* [Installing the Splunk Operator](#installing-the-splunk-operator)\n* [Creating Splunk Enterprise Deployments](#creating-a-splunk-enterprise-deployment)\n* [Securing Splunk Deployments in Kubernetes](Security.md)\n* [Contacting Support](#contacting-support)\n\n## Support Resources\n\nSPLUNK SUPPORTED: The Splunk Operator for Kubernetes is a supported method for deploying distributed Splunk Enterprise environments using containers.\n\nCOMMUNITY DEVELOPED: Splunk Operator for Kubernetes is an open source product developed by Splunkers with contributions from the community of partners and customers. The primary reason why Splunk is taking this approach is to push product development closer to those that use and depend upon it. This direct connection will help us all be more successful and move at a rapid pace.\n\nIf you're interested in contributing to the SOK open source project, review the [Contributing to the Project](CONTRIBUTING.md) page.\n\n**Community Support & Discussions on\n[Slack](https://splunk-usergroups.slack.com)** channel #splunk-operator-for-kubernetes\n\n**File Issues or Enhancements in\n[GitHub](https://github.com/splunk/splunk-operator/issues)** splunk/splunk-operator\n\n\n## Known Issues for the Splunk Operator\n\nReview the [Change Log](ChangeLog.md) page for a history of changes in each release.\n\n## Prerequisites for the Splunk Operator\n\n### Supported Kubernetes Versions\n\n- Kubernetes, version 1.16.2+ and later (x86 64-bit only).\n\nThe Splunk Operator should work with any [CNCF certified distribution](https://www.cncf.io/certification/software-conformance/) of Kubernetes. We do not have platform recommendations, but this is a table of platforms that our developers, customers, and partners have used successfully with the Splunk Operator.\n\n<table>\n<tr><td> Splunk Development & Testing Platforms </td><td> Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS), Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) </td></tr>\n<tr><td> Customer Reported Platforms </td><td> Microsoft Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), Red Hat OpenShift </td></tr>\n<tr><td> Partner Tested Platforms</td><td> HPE Ezmeral</td></tr>\n<tr><td> Other Platforms </td><td>CNCF certified distribution</td></tr>\n</table>\n\n### Splunk Enterprise Compatibility\nEach Splunk Operator release has specific Splunk Enterprise compatibility requirements. Before installing or upgrading the Splunk Operator, review the [Change Log](ChangeLog.md) to verify version compatibility with Splunk Enterprise releases.\n\n### Splunk Apps Installation\n\nApps and add-ons can be installed using the Splunk Operator by following the instructions given at [Installing Splunk Apps](Examples.md#installing-splunk-apps).  Premium apps such as Enterprise Security and IT Service Intelligence are currently not supported.\n\n\n### Docker requirements\nThe Splunk Operator requires these docker images to be present or available to your Kubernetes cluster:\n\n* `splunk/splunk-operator`: The Splunk Operator image built by this repository or the [official release](https://hub.docker.com/r/splunk/splunk-operator) (2.0.0 or later)\n* `splunk/splunk:<version>`: The [Splunk Enterprise image](https://github.com/splunk/docker-splunk) (9.0.0 or later)\n\nAll of the Splunk Enterprise images are publicly available on [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/). If your cluster does not have access to pull from Docker Hub, see the [Required Images Documentation](Images.md) page.\n\nReview the [Change Log](ChangeLog.md) page for a history of changes and Splunk Enterprise compatibility for each release.\n\n### Hardware Resources Requirements\nThe resource guidelines for running production Splunk Enterprise instances in pods through the Splunk Operator are the same as running Splunk Enterprise natively on a supported operating system and file system. Refer to the Splunk Enterprise [Reference Hardware documentation](https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/latest/Capacity/Referencehardware) for additional details.  We would also recommend following the same guidance on [Splunk Enterprise for disabling Transparent Huge Pages (THP)](https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/latest/ReleaseNotes/SplunkandTHP) for the nodes in your Kubernetes cluster.  Please be aware that this may impact performance of other non-Splunk workloads.\n\n#### Minimum Reference Hardware\nBased on Splunk Enterprise [Reference Hardware documentation](https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/latest/Capacity/Referencehardware), a summary of the minimum reference hardware requirements is given below.\n\n| Standalone        | Search Head / Search Head Cluster | Indexer Cluster |\n| ---------- | ------- | ------- |\n| _Each Standalone Pod: 12 Physical CPU Cores or 24 vCPU at 2Ghz or greater per core, 12GB RAM._| _Each Search Head Pod: 16 Physical CPU Cores or 32 vCPU at 2Ghz or greater per core, 12GB RAM._| _Each Indexer Pod: 12 Physical CPU cores, or 24 vCPU at 2GHz or greater per core, 12GB RAM._ |\n\n\n#### _Using Kubernetes Quality of Service Classes_\n\nIn addition to the guidelines provided in the reference hardware, [Kubernetes Quality of Service Classes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/quality-service-pod/)  can be used to configure CPU/Mem resources allocations that map to your _service level objectives_. For further information on utilizing Kubernetes Quality of Service (QoS) classes, see the table below:\n\n\n| QoS        | Summary| Description |\n| ---------- | ------- | ------- |\n| _Guaranteed_ | _CPU/Mem ```requests``` = CPU/Mem ```limits```_    | _When the CPU and memory  ```requests``` and ```limits``` values are equal, the pod is given a QoS class of Guaranteed. This level of service is recommended for Splunk Enterprise ___production environments___._ |\n| _Burstable_ | _CPU/Mem ```requests``` < CPU/Mem ```limits```_  | _When the CPU and memory  ```requests``` value is set lower than the ```limits``` the pod is given a QoS class of Burstable. This level of service is useful in a user acceptance testing ___(UAT) environment___, where the pods run with minimum resources, and Kubernetes allocates additional resources depending on usage._|\n| _BestEffort_ | _No CPU/Mem ```requests``` or ```limits``` are set_ | _When the ```requests``` or ```limits``` values are not set, the pod is given a QoS class of BestEffort. This level of service is sufficient for ___testing, or a small development task___._ |\n\nExamples on how to implement these QoS are given at [Examples of Guaranteed and Burstable QoS](CustomResources.md#examples-of-guaranteed-and-burstable-qos) section.\n\n\n### Storage guidelines\nThe Splunk Operator uses Kubernetes [Persistent Volume Claims](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/persistent-volumes/#persistentvolumeclaims) to store all of your Splunk Enterprise configuration (\"$SPLUNK_HOME/etc\" path) and event (\"$SPLUNK_HOME/var\" path) data. If one of the underlying machines fail, Kubernetes will automatically try to recover by restarting the Splunk Enterprise pods on another machine that is able to reuse the same data volumes. This minimizes the maintenance burden on your operations team by reducing the impact of common hardware failures to the equivalent of a service restart. \nThe use of Persistent Volume Claims requires that your cluster is configured to support one or more Kubernetes persistent [Storage Classes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/storage-classes/). See the [Setting Up a Persistent Storage for Splunk](StorageClass.md) page for more\ninformation.\n\n### What Storage Type To Use?\n\nThe Kubernetes infrastructure must have access to storage that meets or exceeds the recommendations provided in the Splunk Enterprise storage type recommendations at [Reference Hardware documentation - what storage type to use for a given role?](https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/latest/Capacity/Referencehardware#What_storage_type_should_I_use_for_a_role.3F) In summary, Indexers with SmartStore need NVMe or SSD storage to provide the necessary IOPs for a successful Splunk Enterprise environment.\n\n\n### Splunk SmartStore Required\nFor production environments, we are requiring the use of Splunk SmartStore. As a Splunk Enterprise deployment's data volume increases, demand for storage typically outpaces demand for compute resources. [Splunk's SmartStore Feature](https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/latest/Indexer/AboutSmartStore) allows you to manage your indexer storage and compute resources in a ___cost-effective___ manner by scaling those resources separately. SmartStore utilizes a fast storage cache on each indexer node to keep recent data locally available for search and keep other data in a remote object store. Look into the [SmartStore Resource Guide](SmartStore.md) document for configuring and using SmartStore through operator.\n\n## Installing the Splunk Operator\n\nA Kubernetes cluster administrator can install and start the Splunk Operator for specific namespace by running:\n```\nkubectl apply -f https://github.com/splunk/splunk-operator/releases/download/2.0.0/splunk-operator-namespace.yaml\n```\n\nA Kubernetes cluster administrator can install and start the Splunk Operator for cluster-wide by running:\n```\nkubectl apply -f https://github.com/splunk/splunk-operator/releases/download/2.0.0/splunk-operator-cluster.yaml\n```\n\nThe [Advanced Installation Instructions](Install.md) page offers guidance for advanced configurations, including the use of private image registries, installation at cluster scope, and installing the Splunk Operator as a user who is not a Kubernetes administrator. Users of Red Hat OpenShift should review the [Red Hat OpenShift](OpenShift.md) page.\n\nThe [Advanced Installation Instructions](Install.md) page offers guidance for advanced configurations, including the use of private image registries, installation at cluster scope, and installing the Splunk Operator as a user who is not a Kubernetes administrator. Users of Red Hat OpenShift should review the [Red Hat OpenShift](OpenShift.md) page.\n\n*Note: We recommended that the Splunk Enterprise Docker image is copied to a private registry, or directly onto your Kubernetes workers before creating large Splunk Enterprise deployments. See the [Required Images Documentation](Images.md) page, and the [Advanced Installation Instructions](Install.md) page for guidance on working with copies of the Docker images.*\n\nAfter the Splunk Operator starts, you'll see a single pod running within your current namespace:\n```\n$ kubectl get pods\nNAME                               READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE\nsplunk-operator-75f5d4d85b-8pshn   1/1     Running   0          5s\n```\n## Upgrading the Splunk Operator\n\nFor information on upgrading the Splunk Operator, see the [How to upgrade Splunk Operator and Splunk Enterprise Deployments](SplunkOperatorUpgrade.md) page.\n\n## Creating a Splunk Enterprise deployment\n\nThe `Standalone` custom resource is used to create a single instance deployment of Splunk Enterprise. For example:\n\n1. Run the command to create a deployment named \u201cs1\u201d:\n\n\n```yaml\ncat <<EOF | kubectl apply -n splunk-operator -f -\napiVersion: enterprise.splunk.com/v3\nkind: Standalone\nmetadata:\n  name: s1\n  finalizers:\n  - enterprise.splunk.com/delete-pvc\nEOF\n```\n\n**The `enterprise.splunk.com/delete-pvc` finalizer is optional, and tells the Splunk Operator to remove any Kubernetes [Persistent Volumes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/persistent-volumes/) associated with the instance if you delete the pod.**\n\nWithin a few minutes, you'll see new pods running in your namespace:\n\n```\n$ kubectl get pods\nNAME                                   READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE\nsplunk-operator-7c5599546c-wt4xl        1/1    Running   0          11h\nsplunk-s1-standalone-0                  1/1    Running   0          45s\n```\n\n*Note: if your shell prints a `%` at the end, leave that out when you copy the output.*\n\n2. You can use a simple network port forward to open port 8000 for Splunk Web access:\n\n```\nkubectl port-forward splunk-s1-standalone-0 8000\n```\n\n3. Get your passwords for the namespace. The Splunk Enterprise passwords used in the namespace are generated automatically. To learn how to find and read the passwords, see the [Reading global kubernetes secret object](Examples.md#reading-global-kubernetes-secret-object) page.\n\n\n4. Log into Splunk Enterprise at http://localhost:8000 using the `admin` account with the password.\n\n5. To delete your standalone deployment, run:\n\n```\nkubectl delete standalone s1\n``` \n\nThe `Standalone` custom resource is just one of the resources the Splunk Operator provides. You can find more custom resources and the parameters they support on the [Custom Resource Guide](CustomResources.md) page.\n\nFor additional deployment examples, including Splunk Enterprise clusters, see the \n[Configuring Splunk Enterprise Deployments](Examples.md) page.\n\nFor additional guidance on making Splunk Enterprise ports accessible outside of Kubernetes, see the [Configuring Ingress](Ingress.md) page.\n\n## Contacting Support\nIf you are a Splunk Enterprise customer with a valid support entitlement contract and have a Splunk-related question, you can open a support case on the https://www.splunk.com/ support portal.\"\n",

      "csv_description": "# Getting Started with the Splunk Operator for Kubernetes\nThe Splunk Operator for Kubernetes enables you to quickly and easily deploy Splunk Enterprise on your choice of private or public cloud provider. The Operator simplifies scaling and management of Splunk Enterprise by automating administrative workflows using Kubernetes best practices. \n\nThe Splunk Operator runs as a container, and uses the Kubernetes [operator pattern](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/operator/) and [custom resources](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/api-extension/custom-resources/) objects to create and manage a scalable and sustainable Splunk Enterprise environment.\n\nThis guide is intended to help new users get up and running with the\nSplunk Operator for Kubernetes. It is divided into the following sections:\n\n* [Known Issues for the Splunk Operator](#known-issues-for-the-splunk-operator)\n* [Prerequisites for the Splunk Operator](#prerequisites-for-the-splunk-operator)\n* [Installing the Splunk Operator](#installing-the-splunk-operator)\n* [Creating Splunk Enterprise Deployments](#creating-a-splunk-enterprise-deployment)\n* [Securing Splunk Deployments in Kubernetes](Security.md)\n* [Contacting Support](#contacting-support)\n\n## Support Resources\n\nSPLUNK SUPPORTED: The Splunk Operator for Kubernetes is a supported method for deploying distributed Splunk Enterprise environments using containers.\n\nCOMMUNITY DEVELOPED: Splunk Operator for Kubernetes is an open source product developed by Splunkers with contributions from the community of partners and customers. The primary reason why Splunk is taking this approach is to push product development closer to those that use and depend upon it. This direct connection will help us all be more successful and move at a rapid pace.\n\nIf you're interested in contributing to the SOK open source project, review the [Contributing to the Project](CONTRIBUTING.md) page.\n\n**Community Support & Discussions on\n[Slack](https://splunk-usergroups.slack.com)** channel #splunk-operator-for-kubernetes\n\n**File Issues or Enhancements in\n[GitHub](https://github.com/splunk/splunk-operator/issues)** splunk/splunk-operator\n\n\n## Known Issues for the Splunk Operator\n\nReview the [Change Log](ChangeLog.md) page for a history of changes in each release.\n\n## Prerequisites for the Splunk Operator\n\n### Supported Kubernetes Versions\n\n- Kubernetes, version 1.16.2+ and later (x86 64-bit only).\n\nThe Splunk Operator should work with any [CNCF certified distribution](https://www.cncf.io/certification/software-conformance/) of Kubernetes. We do not have platform recommendations, but this is a table of platforms that our developers, customers, and partners have used successfully with the Splunk Operator.\n\n<table>\n<tr><td> Splunk Development & Testing Platforms </td><td> Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS), Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) </td></tr>\n<tr><td> Customer Reported Platforms </td><td> Microsoft Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), Red Hat OpenShift </td></tr>\n<tr><td> Partner Tested Platforms</td><td> HPE Ezmeral</td></tr>\n<tr><td> Other Platforms </td><td>CNCF certified distribution</td></tr>\n</table>\n\n### Splunk Enterprise Compatibility\nEach Splunk Operator release has specific Splunk Enterprise compatibility requirements. Before installing or upgrading the Splunk Operator, review the [Change Log](ChangeLog.md) to verify version compatibility with Splunk Enterprise releases.\n\n### Splunk Apps Installation\n\nApps and add-ons can be installed using the Splunk Operator by following the instructions given at [Installing Splunk Apps](Examples.md#installing-splunk-apps).  Premium apps such as Enterprise Security and IT Service Intelligence are currently not supported.\n\n\n### Docker requirements\nThe Splunk Operator requires these docker images to be present or available to your Kubernetes cluster:\n\n* `splunk/splunk-operator`: The Splunk Operator image built by this repository or the [official release](https://hub.docker.com/r/splunk/splunk-operator) (2.0.0 or later)\n* `splunk/splunk:<version>`: The [Splunk Enterprise image](https://github.com/splunk/docker-splunk) (9.0.0 or later)\n\nAll of the Splunk Enterprise images are publicly available on [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/). If your cluster does not have access to pull from Docker Hub, see the [Required Images Documentation](Images.md) page.\n\nReview the [Change Log](ChangeLog.md) page for a history of changes and Splunk Enterprise compatibility for each release.\n\n### Hardware Resources Requirements\nThe resource guidelines for running production Splunk Enterprise instances in pods through the Splunk Operator are the same as running Splunk Enterprise natively on a supported operating system and file system. Refer to the Splunk Enterprise [Reference Hardware documentation](https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/latest/Capacity/Referencehardware) for additional details.  We would also recommend following the same guidance on [Splunk Enterprise for disabling Transparent Huge Pages (THP)](https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/latest/ReleaseNotes/SplunkandTHP) for the nodes in your Kubernetes cluster.  Please be aware that this may impact performance of other non-Splunk workloads.\n\n#### Minimum Reference Hardware\nBased on Splunk Enterprise [Reference Hardware documentation](https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/latest/Capacity/Referencehardware), a summary of the minimum reference hardware requirements is given below.\n\n| Standalone        | Search Head / Search Head Cluster | Indexer Cluster |\n| ---------- | ------- | ------- |\n| _Each Standalone Pod: 12 Physical CPU Cores or 24 vCPU at 2Ghz or greater per core, 12GB RAM._| _Each Search Head Pod: 16 Physical CPU Cores or 32 vCPU at 2Ghz or greater per core, 12GB RAM._| _Each Indexer Pod: 12 Physical CPU cores, or 24 vCPU at 2GHz or greater per core, 12GB RAM._ |\n\n\n#### _Using Kubernetes Quality of Service Classes_\n\nIn addition to the guidelines provided in the reference hardware, [Kubernetes Quality of Service Classes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/quality-service-pod/)  can be used to configure CPU/Mem resources allocations that map to your _service level objectives_. For further information on utilizing Kubernetes Quality of Service (QoS) classes, see the table below:\n\n\n| QoS        | Summary| Description |\n| ---------- | ------- | ------- |\n| _Guaranteed_ | _CPU/Mem ```requests``` = CPU/Mem ```limits```_    | _When the CPU and memory  ```requests``` and ```limits``` values are equal, the pod is given a QoS class of Guaranteed. This level of service is recommended for Splunk Enterprise ___production environments___._ |\n| _Burstable_ | _CPU/Mem ```requests``` < CPU/Mem ```limits```_  | _When the CPU and memory  ```requests``` value is set lower than the ```limits``` the pod is given a QoS class of Burstable. This level of service is useful in a user acceptance testing ___(UAT) environment___, where the pods run with minimum resources, and Kubernetes allocates additional resources depending on usage._|\n| _BestEffort_ | _No CPU/Mem ```requests``` or ```limits``` are set_ | _When the ```requests``` or ```limits``` values are not set, the pod is given a QoS class of BestEffort. This level of service is sufficient for ___testing, or a small development task___._ |\n\nExamples on how to implement these QoS are given at [Examples of Guaranteed and Burstable QoS](CustomResources.md#examples-of-guaranteed-and-burstable-qos) section.\n\n\n### Storage guidelines\nThe Splunk Operator uses Kubernetes [Persistent Volume Claims](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/persistent-volumes/#persistentvolumeclaims) to store all of your Splunk Enterprise configuration (\"$SPLUNK_HOME/etc\" path) and event (\"$SPLUNK_HOME/var\" path) data. If one of the underlying machines fail, Kubernetes will automatically try to recover by restarting the Splunk Enterprise pods on another machine that is able to reuse the same data volumes. This minimizes the maintenance burden on your operations team by reducing the impact of common hardware failures to the equivalent of a service restart. \nThe use of Persistent Volume Claims requires that your cluster is configured to support one or more Kubernetes persistent [Storage Classes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/storage-classes/). See the [Setting Up a Persistent Storage for Splunk](StorageClass.md) page for more\ninformation.\n\n### What Storage Type To Use?\n\nThe Kubernetes infrastructure must have access to storage that meets or exceeds the recommendations provided in the Splunk Enterprise storage type recommendations at [Reference Hardware documentation - what storage type to use for a given role?](https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/latest/Capacity/Referencehardware#What_storage_type_should_I_use_for_a_role.3F) In summary, Indexers with SmartStore need NVMe or SSD storage to provide the necessary IOPs for a successful Splunk Enterprise environment.\n\n\n### Splunk SmartStore Required\nFor production environments, we are requiring the use of Splunk SmartStore. As a Splunk Enterprise deployment's data volume increases, demand for storage typically outpaces demand for compute resources. [Splunk's SmartStore Feature](https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/latest/Indexer/AboutSmartStore) allows you to manage your indexer storage and compute resources in a ___cost-effective___ manner by scaling those resources separately. SmartStore utilizes a fast storage cache on each indexer node to keep recent data locally available for search and keep other data in a remote object store. Look into the [SmartStore Resource Guide](SmartStore.md) document for configuring and using SmartStore through operator.\n\n## Installing the Splunk Operator\n\nA Kubernetes cluster administrator can install and start the Splunk Operator for specific namespace by running:\n```\nkubectl apply -f https://github.com/splunk/splunk-operator/releases/download/2.0.0/splunk-operator-namespace.yaml\n```\n\nA Kubernetes cluster administrator can install and start the Splunk Operator for cluster-wide by running:\n```\nkubectl apply -f https://github.com/splunk/splunk-operator/releases/download/2.0.0/splunk-operator-cluster.yaml\n```\n\nThe [Advanced Installation Instructions](Install.md) page offers guidance for advanced configurations, including the use of private image registries, installation at cluster scope, and installing the Splunk Operator as a user who is not a Kubernetes administrator. Users of Red Hat OpenShift should review the [Red Hat OpenShift](OpenShift.md) page.\n\nThe [Advanced Installation Instructions](Install.md) page offers guidance for advanced configurations, including the use of private image registries, installation at cluster scope, and installing the Splunk Operator as a user who is not a Kubernetes administrator. Users of Red Hat OpenShift should review the [Red Hat OpenShift](OpenShift.md) page.\n\n*Note: We recommended that the Splunk Enterprise Docker image is copied to a private registry, or directly onto your Kubernetes workers before creating large Splunk Enterprise deployments. See the [Required Images Documentation](Images.md) page, and the [Advanced Installation Instructions](Install.md) page for guidance on working with copies of the Docker images.*\n\nAfter the Splunk Operator starts, you'll see a single pod running within your current namespace:\n```\n$ kubectl get pods\nNAME                               READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE\nsplunk-operator-75f5d4d85b-8pshn   1/1     Running   0          5s\n```\n## Upgrading the Splunk Operator\n\nFor information on upgrading the Splunk Operator, see the [How to upgrade Splunk Operator and Splunk Enterprise Deployments](SplunkOperatorUpgrade.md) page.\n\n## Creating a Splunk Enterprise deployment\n\nThe `Standalone` custom resource is used to create a single instance deployment of Splunk Enterprise. For example:\n\n1. Run the command to create a deployment named \u201cs1\u201d:\n\n\n```yaml\ncat <<EOF | kubectl apply -n splunk-operator -f -\napiVersion: enterprise.splunk.com/v3\nkind: Standalone\nmetadata:\n  name: s1\n  finalizers:\n  - enterprise.splunk.com/delete-pvc\nEOF\n```\n\n**The `enterprise.splunk.com/delete-pvc` finalizer is optional, and tells the Splunk Operator to remove any Kubernetes [Persistent Volumes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/persistent-volumes/) associated with the instance if you delete the pod.**\n\nWithin a few minutes, you'll see new pods running in your namespace:\n\n```\n$ kubectl get pods\nNAME                                   READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE\nsplunk-operator-7c5599546c-wt4xl        1/1    Running   0          11h\nsplunk-s1-standalone-0                  1/1    Running   0          45s\n```\n\n*Note: if your shell prints a `%` at the end, leave that out when you copy the output.*\n\n2. You can use a simple network port forward to open port 8000 for Splunk Web access:\n\n```\nkubectl port-forward splunk-s1-standalone-0 8000\n```\n\n3. Get your passwords for the namespace. The Splunk Enterprise passwords used in the namespace are generated automatically. To learn how to find and read the passwords, see the [Reading global kubernetes secret object](Examples.md#reading-global-kubernetes-secret-object) page.\n\n\n4. Log into Splunk Enterprise at http://localhost:8000 using the `admin` account with the password.\n\n5. To delete your standalone deployment, run:\n\n```\nkubectl delete standalone s1\n``` \n\nThe `Standalone` custom resource is just one of the resources the Splunk Operator provides. You can find more custom resources and the parameters they support on the [Custom Resource Guide](CustomResources.md) page.\n\nFor additional deployment examples, including Splunk Enterprise clusters, see the \n[Configuring Splunk Enterprise Deployments](Examples.md) page.\n\nFor additional guidance on making Splunk Enterprise ports accessible outside of Kubernetes, see the [Configuring Ingress](Ingress.md) page.\n\n## Contacting Support\nIf you are a Splunk Enterprise customer with a valid support entitlement contract and have a Splunk-related question, you can open a support case on the https://www.splunk.com/ support portal.\"\n",

      "csv_description": "# Getting Started with the Splunk Operator for Kubernetes\nThe Splunk Operator for Kubernetes enables you to quickly and easily deploy Splunk Enterprise on your choice of private or public cloud provider. The Operator simplifies scaling and management of Splunk Enterprise by automating administrative workflows using Kubernetes best practices. \n\nThe Splunk Operator runs as a container, and uses the Kubernetes [operator pattern](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/operator/) and [custom resources](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/api-extension/custom-resources/) objects to create and manage a scalable and sustainable Splunk Enterprise environment.\n\nThis guide is intended to help new users get up and running with the\nSplunk Operator for Kubernetes. It is divided into the following sections:\n\n* [Known Issues for the Splunk Operator](#known-issues-for-the-splunk-operator)\n* [Prerequisites for the Splunk Operator](#prerequisites-for-the-splunk-operator)\n* [Installing the Splunk Operator](#installing-the-splunk-operator)\n* [Creating Splunk Enterprise Deployments](#creating-a-splunk-enterprise-deployment)\n* [Securing Splunk Deployments in Kubernetes](Security.md)\n* [Contacting Support](#contacting-support)\n\n## Support Resources\n\nSPLUNK SUPPORTED: The Splunk Operator for Kubernetes is a supported method for deploying distributed Splunk Enterprise environments using containers.\n\nCOMMUNITY DEVELOPED: Splunk Operator for Kubernetes is an open source product developed by Splunkers with contributions from the community of partners and customers. The primary reason why Splunk is taking this approach is to push product development closer to those that use and depend upon it. This direct connection will help us all be more successful and move at a rapid pace.\n\nIf you're interested in contributing to the SOK open source project, review the [Contributing to the Project](CONTRIBUTING.md) page.\n\n**Community Support & Discussions on\n[Slack](https://splunk-usergroups.slack.com)** channel #splunk-operator-for-kubernetes\n\n**File Issues or Enhancements in\n[GitHub](https://github.com/splunk/splunk-operator/issues)** splunk/splunk-operator\n\n\n## Known Issues for the Splunk Operator\n\nReview the [Change Log](ChangeLog.md) page for a history of changes in each release.\n\n## Prerequisites for the Splunk Operator\n\n### Supported Kubernetes Versions\n\n- Kubernetes, version 1.16.2+ and later (x86 64-bit only).\n\nThe Splunk Operator should work with any [CNCF certified distribution](https://www.cncf.io/certification/software-conformance/) of Kubernetes. We do not have platform recommendations, but this is a table of platforms that our developers, customers, and partners have used successfully with the Splunk Operator.\n\n<table>\n<tr><td> Splunk Development & Testing Platforms </td><td> Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS), Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) </td></tr>\n<tr><td> Customer Reported Platforms </td><td> Microsoft Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), Red Hat OpenShift </td></tr>\n<tr><td> Partner Tested Platforms</td><td> HPE Ezmeral</td></tr>\n<tr><td> Other Platforms </td><td>CNCF certified distribution</td></tr>\n</table>\n\n### Splunk Enterprise Compatibility\nEach Splunk Operator release has specific Splunk Enterprise compatibility requirements. Before installing or upgrading the Splunk Operator, review the [Change Log](ChangeLog.md) to verify version compatibility with Splunk Enterprise releases.\n\n### Splunk Apps Installation\n\nApps and add-ons can be installed using the Splunk Operator by following the instructions given at [Installing Splunk Apps](Examples.md#installing-splunk-apps).  Premium apps such as Enterprise Security and IT Service Intelligence are currently not supported.\n\n\n### Docker requirements\nThe Splunk Operator requires these docker images to be present or available to your Kubernetes cluster:\n\n* `splunk/splunk-operator`: The Splunk Operator image built by this repository or the [official release](https://hub.docker.com/r/splunk/splunk-operator) (2.0.0 or later)\n* `splunk/splunk:<version>`: The [Splunk Enterprise image](https://github.com/splunk/docker-splunk) (9.0.0 or later)\n\nAll of the Splunk Enterprise images are publicly available on [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/). If your cluster does not have access to pull from Docker Hub, see the [Required Images Documentation](Images.md) page.\n\nReview the [Change Log](ChangeLog.md) page for a history of changes and Splunk Enterprise compatibility for each release.\n\n### Hardware Resources Requirements\nThe resource guidelines for running production Splunk Enterprise instances in pods through the Splunk Operator are the same as running Splunk Enterprise natively on a supported operating system and file system. Refer to the Splunk Enterprise [Reference Hardware documentation](https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/latest/Capacity/Referencehardware) for additional details.  We would also recommend following the same guidance on [Splunk Enterprise for disabling Transparent Huge Pages (THP)](https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/latest/ReleaseNotes/SplunkandTHP) for the nodes in your Kubernetes cluster.  Please be aware that this may impact performance of other non-Splunk workloads.\n\n#### Minimum Reference Hardware\nBased on Splunk Enterprise [Reference Hardware documentation](https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/latest/Capacity/Referencehardware), a summary of the minimum reference hardware requirements is given below.\n\n| Standalone        | Search Head / Search Head Cluster | Indexer Cluster |\n| ---------- | ------- | ------- |\n| _Each Standalone Pod: 12 Physical CPU Cores or 24 vCPU at 2Ghz or greater per core, 12GB RAM._| _Each Search Head Pod: 16 Physical CPU Cores or 32 vCPU at 2Ghz or greater per core, 12GB RAM._| _Each Indexer Pod: 12 Physical CPU cores, or 24 vCPU at 2GHz or greater per core, 12GB RAM._ |\n\n\n#### _Using Kubernetes Quality of Service Classes_\n\nIn addition to the guidelines provided in the reference hardware, [Kubernetes Quality of Service Classes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/quality-service-pod/)  can be used to configure CPU/Mem resources allocations that map to your _service level objectives_. For further information on utilizing Kubernetes Quality of Service (QoS) classes, see the table below:\n\n\n| QoS        | Summary| Description |\n| ---------- | ------- | ------- |\n| _Guaranteed_ | _CPU/Mem ```requests``` = CPU/Mem ```limits```_    | _When the CPU and memory  ```requests``` and ```limits``` values are equal, the pod is given a QoS class of Guaranteed. This level of service is recommended for Splunk Enterprise ___production environments___._ |\n| _Burstable_ | _CPU/Mem ```requests``` < CPU/Mem ```limits```_  | _When the CPU and memory  ```requests``` value is set lower than the ```limits``` the pod is given a QoS class of Burstable. This level of service is useful in a user acceptance testing ___(UAT) environment___, where the pods run with minimum resources, and Kubernetes allocates additional resources depending on usage._|\n| _BestEffort_ | _No CPU/Mem ```requests``` or ```limits``` are set_ | _When the ```requests``` or ```limits``` values are not set, the pod is given a QoS class of BestEffort. This level of service is sufficient for ___testing, or a small development task___._ |\n\nExamples on how to implement these QoS are given at [Examples of Guaranteed and Burstable QoS](CustomResources.md#examples-of-guaranteed-and-burstable-qos) section.\n\n\n### Storage guidelines\nThe Splunk Operator uses Kubernetes [Persistent Volume Claims](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/persistent-volumes/#persistentvolumeclaims) to store all of your Splunk Enterprise configuration (\"$SPLUNK_HOME/etc\" path) and event (\"$SPLUNK_HOME/var\" path) data. If one of the underlying machines fail, Kubernetes will automatically try to recover by restarting the Splunk Enterprise pods on another machine that is able to reuse the same data volumes. This minimizes the maintenance burden on your operations team by reducing the impact of common hardware failures to the equivalent of a service restart. \nThe use of Persistent Volume Claims requires that your cluster is configured to support one or more Kubernetes persistent [Storage Classes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/storage-classes/). See the [Setting Up a Persistent Storage for Splunk](StorageClass.md) page for more\ninformation.\n\n### What Storage Type To Use?\n\nThe Kubernetes infrastructure must have access to storage that meets or exceeds the recommendations provided in the Splunk Enterprise storage type recommendations at [Reference Hardware documentation - what storage type to use for a given role?](https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/latest/Capacity/Referencehardware#What_storage_type_should_I_use_for_a_role.3F) In summary, Indexers with SmartStore need NVMe or SSD storage to provide the necessary IOPs for a successful Splunk Enterprise environment.\n\n\n### Splunk SmartStore Required\nFor production environments, we are requiring the use of Splunk SmartStore. As a Splunk Enterprise deployment's data volume increases, demand for storage typically outpaces demand for compute resources. [Splunk's SmartStore Feature](https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/latest/Indexer/AboutSmartStore) allows you to manage your indexer storage and compute resources in a ___cost-effective___ manner by scaling those resources separately. SmartStore utilizes a fast storage cache on each indexer node to keep recent data locally available for search and keep other data in a remote object store. Look into the [SmartStore Resource Guide](SmartStore.md) document for configuring and using SmartStore through operator.\n\n## Installing the Splunk Operator\n\nA Kubernetes cluster administrator can install and start the Splunk Operator for specific namespace by running:\n```\nkubectl apply -f https://github.com/splunk/splunk-operator/releases/download/2.0.0/splunk-operator-namespace.yaml\n```\n\nA Kubernetes cluster administrator can install and start the Splunk Operator for cluster-wide by running:\n```\nkubectl apply -f https://github.com/splunk/splunk-operator/releases/download/2.0.0/splunk-operator-cluster.yaml\n```\n\nThe [Advanced Installation Instructions](Install.md) page offers guidance for advanced configurations, including the use of private image registries, installation at cluster scope, and installing the Splunk Operator as a user who is not a Kubernetes administrator. Users of Red Hat OpenShift should review the [Red Hat OpenShift](OpenShift.md) page.\n\nThe [Advanced Installation Instructions](Install.md) page offers guidance for advanced configurations, including the use of private image registries, installation at cluster scope, and installing the Splunk Operator as a user who is not a Kubernetes administrator. Users of Red Hat OpenShift should review the [Red Hat OpenShift](OpenShift.md) page.\n\n*Note: We recommended that the Splunk Enterprise Docker image is copied to a private registry, or directly onto your Kubernetes workers before creating large Splunk Enterprise deployments. See the [Required Images Documentation](Images.md) page, and the [Advanced Installation Instructions](Install.md) page for guidance on working with copies of the Docker images.*\n\nAfter the Splunk Operator starts, you'll see a single pod running within your current namespace:\n```\n$ kubectl get pods\nNAME                               READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE\nsplunk-operator-75f5d4d85b-8pshn   1/1     Running   0          5s\n```\n## Upgrading the Splunk Operator\n\nFor information on upgrading the Splunk Operator, see the [How to upgrade Splunk Operator and Splunk Enterprise Deployments](SplunkOperatorUpgrade.md) page.\n\n## Creating a Splunk Enterprise deployment\n\nThe `Standalone` custom resource is used to create a single instance deployment of Splunk Enterprise. For example:\n\n1. Run the command to create a deployment named \u201cs1\u201d:\n\n\n```yaml\ncat <<EOF | kubectl apply -n splunk-operator -f -\napiVersion: enterprise.splunk.com/v3\nkind: Standalone\nmetadata:\n  name: s1\n  finalizers:\n  - enterprise.splunk.com/delete-pvc\nEOF\n```\n\n**The `enterprise.splunk.com/delete-pvc` finalizer is optional, and tells the Splunk Operator to remove any Kubernetes [Persistent Volumes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/persistent-volumes/) associated with the instance if you delete the pod.**\n\nWithin a few minutes, you'll see new pods running in your namespace:\n\n```\n$ kubectl get pods\nNAME                                   READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE\nsplunk-operator-7c5599546c-wt4xl        1/1    Running   0          11h\nsplunk-s1-standalone-0                  1/1    Running   0          45s\n```\n\n*Note: if your shell prints a `%` at the end, leave that out when you copy the output.*\n\n2. You can use a simple network port forward to open port 8000 for Splunk Web access:\n\n```\nkubectl port-forward splunk-s1-standalone-0 8000\n```\n\n3. Get your passwords for the namespace. The Splunk Enterprise passwords used in the namespace are generated automatically. To learn how to find and read the passwords, see the [Reading global kubernetes secret object](Examples.md#reading-global-kubernetes-secret-object) page.\n\n\n4. Log into Splunk Enterprise at http://localhost:8000 using the `admin` account with the password.\n\n5. To delete your standalone deployment, run:\n\n```\nkubectl delete standalone s1\n``` \n\nThe `Standalone` custom resource is just one of the resources the Splunk Operator provides. You can find more custom resources and the parameters they support on the [Custom Resource Guide](CustomResources.md) page.\n\nFor additional deployment examples, including Splunk Enterprise clusters, see the \n[Configuring Splunk Enterprise Deployments](Examples.md) page.\n\nFor additional guidance on making Splunk Enterprise ports accessible outside of Kubernetes, see the [Configuring Ingress](Ingress.md) page.\n\n## Contacting Support\nIf you are a Splunk Enterprise customer with a valid support entitlement contract and have a Splunk-related question, you can open a support case on the https://www.splunk.com/ support portal.\"\n",

      "csv_description": "# Getting Started with the Splunk Operator for Kubernetes\nThe Splunk Operator for Kubernetes enables you to quickly and easily deploy Splunk Enterprise on your choice of private or public cloud provider. The Operator simplifies scaling and management of Splunk Enterprise by automating administrative workflows using Kubernetes best practices. \n\nThe Splunk Operator runs as a container, and uses the Kubernetes [operator pattern](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/operator/) and [custom resources](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/api-extension/custom-resources/) objects to create and manage a scalable and sustainable Splunk Enterprise environment.\n\nThis guide is intended to help new users get up and running with the\nSplunk Operator for Kubernetes. It is divided into the following sections:\n\n* [Known Issues for the Splunk Operator](#known-issues-for-the-splunk-operator)\n* [Prerequisites for the Splunk Operator](#prerequisites-for-the-splunk-operator)\n* [Installing the Splunk Operator](#installing-the-splunk-operator)\n* [Creating Splunk Enterprise Deployments](#creating-a-splunk-enterprise-deployment)\n* [Securing Splunk Deployments in Kubernetes](Security.md)\n* [Contacting Support](#contacting-support)\n\n## Support Resources\n\nSPLUNK SUPPORTED: The Splunk Operator for Kubernetes is a supported method for deploying distributed Splunk Enterprise environments using containers.\n\nCOMMUNITY DEVELOPED: Splunk Operator for Kubernetes is an open source product developed by Splunkers with contributions from the community of partners and customers. The primary reason why Splunk is taking this approach is to push product development closer to those that use and depend upon it. This direct connection will help us all be more successful and move at a rapid pace.\n\nIf you're interested in contributing to the SOK open source project, review the [Contributing to the Project](CONTRIBUTING.md) page.\n\n**Community Support & Discussions on\n[Slack](https://splunk-usergroups.slack.com)** channel #splunk-operator-for-kubernetes\n\n**File Issues or Enhancements in\n[GitHub](https://github.com/splunk/splunk-operator/issues)** splunk/splunk-operator\n\n\n## Known Issues for the Splunk Operator\n\nReview the [Change Log](ChangeLog.md) page for a history of changes in each release.\n\n## Prerequisites for the Splunk Operator\n\n### Supported Kubernetes Versions\n\n- Kubernetes, version 1.16.2+ and later (x86 64-bit only).\n\nThe Splunk Operator should work with any [CNCF certified distribution](https://www.cncf.io/certification/software-conformance/) of Kubernetes. We do not have platform recommendations, but this is a table of platforms that our developers, customers, and partners have used successfully with the Splunk Operator.\n\n<table>\n<tr><td> Splunk Development & Testing Platforms </td><td> Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS), Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) </td></tr>\n<tr><td> Customer Reported Platforms </td><td> Microsoft Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), Red Hat OpenShift </td></tr>\n<tr><td> Partner Tested Platforms</td><td> HPE Ezmeral</td></tr>\n<tr><td> Other Platforms </td><td>CNCF certified distribution</td></tr>\n</table>\n\n### Splunk Enterprise Compatibility\nEach Splunk Operator release has specific Splunk Enterprise compatibility requirements. Before installing or upgrading the Splunk Operator, review the [Change Log](ChangeLog.md) to verify version compatibility with Splunk Enterprise releases.\n\n### Splunk Apps Installation\n\nApps and add-ons can be installed using the Splunk Operator by following the instructions given at [Installing Splunk Apps](Examples.md#installing-splunk-apps).  Premium apps such as Enterprise Security and IT Service Intelligence are currently not supported.\n\n\n### Docker requirements\nThe Splunk Operator requires these docker images to be present or available to your Kubernetes cluster:\n\n* `splunk/splunk-operator`: The Splunk Operator image built by this repository or the [official release](https://hub.docker.com/r/splunk/splunk-operator) (2.0.0 or later)\n* `splunk/splunk:<version>`: The [Splunk Enterprise image](https://github.com/splunk/docker-splunk) (9.0.0 or later)\n\nAll of the Splunk Enterprise images are publicly available on [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/). If your cluster does not have access to pull from Docker Hub, see the [Required Images Documentation](Images.md) page.\n\nReview the [Change Log](ChangeLog.md) page for a history of changes and Splunk Enterprise compatibility for each release.\n\n### Hardware Resources Requirements\nThe resource guidelines for running production Splunk Enterprise instances in pods through the Splunk Operator are the same as running Splunk Enterprise natively on a supported operating system and file system. Refer to the Splunk Enterprise [Reference Hardware documentation](https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/latest/Capacity/Referencehardware) for additional details.  We would also recommend following the same guidance on [Splunk Enterprise for disabling Transparent Huge Pages (THP)](https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/latest/ReleaseNotes/SplunkandTHP) for the nodes in your Kubernetes cluster.  Please be aware that this may impact performance of other non-Splunk workloads.\n\n#### Minimum Reference Hardware\nBased on Splunk Enterprise [Reference Hardware documentation](https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/latest/Capacity/Referencehardware), a summary of the minimum reference hardware requirements is given below.\n\n| Standalone        | Search Head / Search Head Cluster | Indexer Cluster |\n| ---------- | ------- | ------- |\n| _Each Standalone Pod: 12 Physical CPU Cores or 24 vCPU at 2Ghz or greater per core, 12GB RAM._| _Each Search Head Pod: 16 Physical CPU Cores or 32 vCPU at 2Ghz or greater per core, 12GB RAM._| _Each Indexer Pod: 12 Physical CPU cores, or 24 vCPU at 2GHz or greater per core, 12GB RAM._ |\n\n\n#### _Using Kubernetes Quality of Service Classes_\n\nIn addition to the guidelines provided in the reference hardware, [Kubernetes Quality of Service Classes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/quality-service-pod/)  can be used to configure CPU/Mem resources allocations that map to your _service level objectives_. For further information on utilizing Kubernetes Quality of Service (QoS) classes, see the table below:\n\n\n| QoS        | Summary| Description |\n| ---------- | ------- | ------- |\n| _Guaranteed_ | _CPU/Mem ```requests``` = CPU/Mem ```limits```_    | _When the CPU and memory  ```requests``` and ```limits``` values are equal, the pod is given a QoS class of Guaranteed. This level of service is recommended for Splunk Enterprise ___production environments___._ |\n| _Burstable_ | _CPU/Mem ```requests``` < CPU/Mem ```limits```_  | _When the CPU and memory  ```requests``` value is set lower than the ```limits``` the pod is given a QoS class of Burstable. This level of service is useful in a user acceptance testing ___(UAT) environment___, where the pods run with minimum resources, and Kubernetes allocates additional resources depending on usage._|\n| _BestEffort_ | _No CPU/Mem ```requests``` or ```limits``` are set_ | _When the ```requests``` or ```limits``` values are not set, the pod is given a QoS class of BestEffort. This level of service is sufficient for ___testing, or a small development task___._ |\n\nExamples on how to implement these QoS are given at [Examples of Guaranteed and Burstable QoS](CustomResources.md#examples-of-guaranteed-and-burstable-qos) section.\n\n\n### Storage guidelines\nThe Splunk Operator uses Kubernetes [Persistent Volume Claims](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/persistent-volumes/#persistentvolumeclaims) to store all of your Splunk Enterprise configuration (\"$SPLUNK_HOME/etc\" path) and event (\"$SPLUNK_HOME/var\" path) data. If one of the underlying machines fail, Kubernetes will automatically try to recover by restarting the Splunk Enterprise pods on another machine that is able to reuse the same data volumes. This minimizes the maintenance burden on your operations team by reducing the impact of common hardware failures to the equivalent of a service restart. \nThe use of Persistent Volume Claims requires that your cluster is configured to support one or more Kubernetes persistent [Storage Classes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/storage-classes/). See the [Setting Up a Persistent Storage for Splunk](StorageClass.md) page for more\ninformation.\n\n### What Storage Type To Use?\n\nThe Kubernetes infrastructure must have access to storage that meets or exceeds the recommendations provided in the Splunk Enterprise storage type recommendations at [Reference Hardware documentation - what storage type to use for a given role?](https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/latest/Capacity/Referencehardware#What_storage_type_should_I_use_for_a_role.3F) In summary, Indexers with SmartStore need NVMe or SSD storage to provide the necessary IOPs for a successful Splunk Enterprise environment.\n\n\n### Splunk SmartStore Required\nFor production environments, we are requiring the use of Splunk SmartStore. As a Splunk Enterprise deployment's data volume increases, demand for storage typically outpaces demand for compute resources. [Splunk's SmartStore Feature](https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/latest/Indexer/AboutSmartStore) allows you to manage your indexer storage and compute resources in a ___cost-effective___ manner by scaling those resources separately. SmartStore utilizes a fast storage cache on each indexer node to keep recent data locally available for search and keep other data in a remote object store. Look into the [SmartStore Resource Guide](SmartStore.md) document for configuring and using SmartStore through operator.\n\n## Installing the Splunk Operator\n\nA Kubernetes cluster administrator can install and start the Splunk Operator for specific namespace by running:\n```\nkubectl apply -f https://github.com/splunk/splunk-operator/releases/download/2.0.0/splunk-operator-namespace.yaml\n```\n\nA Kubernetes cluster administrator can install and start the Splunk Operator for cluster-wide by running:\n```\nkubectl apply -f https://github.com/splunk/splunk-operator/releases/download/2.0.0/splunk-operator-cluster.yaml\n```\n\nThe [Advanced Installation Instructions](Install.md) page offers guidance for advanced configurations, including the use of private image registries, installation at cluster scope, and installing the Splunk Operator as a user who is not a Kubernetes administrator. Users of Red Hat OpenShift should review the [Red Hat OpenShift](OpenShift.md) page.\n\nThe [Advanced Installation Instructions](Install.md) page offers guidance for advanced configurations, including the use of private image registries, installation at cluster scope, and installing the Splunk Operator as a user who is not a Kubernetes administrator. Users of Red Hat OpenShift should review the [Red Hat OpenShift](OpenShift.md) page.\n\n*Note: We recommended that the Splunk Enterprise Docker image is copied to a private registry, or directly onto your Kubernetes workers before creating large Splunk Enterprise deployments. See the [Required Images Documentation](Images.md) page, and the [Advanced Installation Instructions](Install.md) page for guidance on working with copies of the Docker images.*\n\nAfter the Splunk Operator starts, you'll see a single pod running within your current namespace:\n```\n$ kubectl get pods\nNAME                               READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE\nsplunk-operator-75f5d4d85b-8pshn   1/1     Running   0          5s\n```\n## Upgrading the Splunk Operator\n\nFor information on upgrading the Splunk Operator, see the [How to upgrade Splunk Operator and Splunk Enterprise Deployments](SplunkOperatorUpgrade.md) page.\n\n## Creating a Splunk Enterprise deployment\n\nThe `Standalone` custom resource is used to create a single instance deployment of Splunk Enterprise. For example:\n\n1. Run the command to create a deployment named \u201cs1\u201d:\n\n\n```yaml\ncat <<EOF | kubectl apply -n splunk-operator -f -\napiVersion: enterprise.splunk.com/v3\nkind: Standalone\nmetadata:\n  name: s1\n  finalizers:\n  - enterprise.splunk.com/delete-pvc\nEOF\n```\n\n**The `enterprise.splunk.com/delete-pvc` finalizer is optional, and tells the Splunk Operator to remove any Kubernetes [Persistent Volumes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/persistent-volumes/) associated with the instance if you delete the pod.**\n\nWithin a few minutes, you'll see new pods running in your namespace:\n\n```\n$ kubectl get pods\nNAME                                   READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE\nsplunk-operator-7c5599546c-wt4xl        1/1    Running   0          11h\nsplunk-s1-standalone-0                  1/1    Running   0          45s\n```\n\n*Note: if your shell prints a `%` at the end, leave that out when you copy the output.*\n\n2. You can use a simple network port forward to open port 8000 for Splunk Web access:\n\n```\nkubectl port-forward splunk-s1-standalone-0 8000\n```\n\n3. Get your passwords for the namespace. The Splunk Enterprise passwords used in the namespace are generated automatically. To learn how to find and read the passwords, see the [Reading global kubernetes secret object](Examples.md#reading-global-kubernetes-secret-object) page.\n\n\n4. Log into Splunk Enterprise at http://localhost:8000 using the `admin` account with the password.\n\n5. To delete your standalone deployment, run:\n\n```\nkubectl delete standalone s1\n``` \n\nThe `Standalone` custom resource is just one of the resources the Splunk Operator provides. You can find more custom resources and the parameters they support on the [Custom Resource Guide](CustomResources.md) page.\n\nFor additional deployment examples, including Splunk Enterprise clusters, see the \n[Configuring Splunk Enterprise Deployments](Examples.md) page.\n\nFor additional guidance on making Splunk Enterprise ports accessible outside of Kubernetes, see the [Configuring Ingress](Ingress.md) page.\n\n## Contacting Support\nIf you are a Splunk Enterprise customer with a valid support entitlement contract and have a Splunk-related question, you can open a support case on the https://www.splunk.com/ support portal.\"\n",

      "csv_description": "# Getting Started with the Splunk Operator for Kubernetes\nThe Splunk Operator for Kubernetes enables you to quickly and easily deploy Splunk Enterprise on your choice of private or public cloud provider. The Operator simplifies scaling and management of Splunk Enterprise by automating administrative workflows using Kubernetes best practices. \n\nThe Splunk Operator runs as a container, and uses the Kubernetes [operator pattern](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/operator/) and [custom resources](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/api-extension/custom-resources/) objects to create and manage a scalable and sustainable Splunk Enterprise environment.\n\nThis guide is intended to help new users get up and running with the\nSplunk Operator for Kubernetes. It is divided into the following sections:\n\n* [Known Issues for the Splunk Operator](#known-issues-for-the-splunk-operator)\n* [Prerequisites for the Splunk Operator](#prerequisites-for-the-splunk-operator)\n* [Installing the Splunk Operator](#installing-the-splunk-operator)\n* [Creating Splunk Enterprise Deployments](#creating-a-splunk-enterprise-deployment)\n* [Securing Splunk Deployments in Kubernetes](Security.md)\n* [Contacting Support](#contacting-support)\n\n## Support Resources\n\nSPLUNK SUPPORTED: The Splunk Operator for Kubernetes is a supported method for deploying distributed Splunk Enterprise environments using containers.\n\nCOMMUNITY DEVELOPED: Splunk Operator for Kubernetes is an open source product developed by Splunkers with contributions from the community of partners and customers. The primary reason why Splunk is taking this approach is to push product development closer to those that use and depend upon it. This direct connection will help us all be more successful and move at a rapid pace.\n\nIf you're interested in contributing to the SOK open source project, review the [Contributing to the Project](CONTRIBUTING.md) page.\n\n**Community Support & Discussions on\n[Slack](https://splunk-usergroups.slack.com)** channel #splunk-operator-for-kubernetes\n\n**File Issues or Enhancements in\n[GitHub](https://github.com/splunk/splunk-operator/issues)** splunk/splunk-operator\n\n\n## Known Issues for the Splunk Operator\n\nReview the [Change Log](ChangeLog.md) page for a history of changes in each release.\n\n## Prerequisites for the Splunk Operator\n\n### Supported Kubernetes Versions\n\n- Kubernetes, version 1.16.2+ and later (x86 64-bit only).\n\nThe Splunk Operator should work with any [CNCF certified distribution](https://www.cncf.io/certification/software-conformance/) of Kubernetes. We do not have platform recommendations, but this is a table of platforms that our developers, customers, and partners have used successfully with the Splunk Operator.\n\n<table>\n<tr><td> Splunk Development & Testing Platforms </td><td> Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS), Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) </td></tr>\n<tr><td> Customer Reported Platforms </td><td> Microsoft Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), Red Hat OpenShift </td></tr>\n<tr><td> Partner Tested Platforms</td><td> HPE Ezmeral</td></tr>\n<tr><td> Other Platforms </td><td>CNCF certified distribution</td></tr>\n</table>\n\n### Splunk Enterprise Compatibility\nEach Splunk Operator release has specific Splunk Enterprise compatibility requirements. Before installing or upgrading the Splunk Operator, review the [Change Log](ChangeLog.md) to verify version compatibility with Splunk Enterprise releases.\n\n### Splunk Apps Installation\n\nApps and add-ons can be installed using the Splunk Operator by following the instructions given at [Installing Splunk Apps](Examples.md#installing-splunk-apps).  Premium apps such as Enterprise Security and IT Service Intelligence are currently not supported.\n\n\n### Docker requirements\nThe Splunk Operator requires these docker images to be present or available to your Kubernetes cluster:\n\n* `splunk/splunk-operator`: The Splunk Operator image built by this repository or the [official release](https://hub.docker.com/r/splunk/splunk-operator) (2.0.0 or later)\n* `splunk/splunk:<version>`: The [Splunk Enterprise image](https://github.com/splunk/docker-splunk) (9.0.0 or later)\n\nAll of the Splunk Enterprise images are publicly available on [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/). If your cluster does not have access to pull from Docker Hub, see the [Required Images Documentation](Images.md) page.\n\nReview the [Change Log](ChangeLog.md) page for a history of changes and Splunk Enterprise compatibility for each release.\n\n### Hardware Resources Requirements\nThe resource guidelines for running production Splunk Enterprise instances in pods through the Splunk Operator are the same as running Splunk Enterprise natively on a supported operating system and file system. Refer to the Splunk Enterprise [Reference Hardware documentation](https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/latest/Capacity/Referencehardware) for additional details.  We would also recommend following the same guidance on [Splunk Enterprise for disabling Transparent Huge Pages (THP)](https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/latest/ReleaseNotes/SplunkandTHP) for the nodes in your Kubernetes cluster.  Please be aware that this may impact performance of other non-Splunk workloads.\n\n#### Minimum Reference Hardware\nBased on Splunk Enterprise [Reference Hardware documentation](https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/latest/Capacity/Referencehardware), a summary of the minimum reference hardware requirements is given below.\n\n| Standalone        | Search Head / Search Head Cluster | Indexer Cluster |\n| ---------- | ------- | ------- |\n| _Each Standalone Pod: 12 Physical CPU Cores or 24 vCPU at 2Ghz or greater per core, 12GB RAM._| _Each Search Head Pod: 16 Physical CPU Cores or 32 vCPU at 2Ghz or greater per core, 12GB RAM._| _Each Indexer Pod: 12 Physical CPU cores, or 24 vCPU at 2GHz or greater per core, 12GB RAM._ |\n\n\n#### _Using Kubernetes Quality of Service Classes_\n\nIn addition to the guidelines provided in the reference hardware, [Kubernetes Quality of Service Classes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/quality-service-pod/)  can be used to configure CPU/Mem resources allocations that map to your _service level objectives_. For further information on utilizing Kubernetes Quality of Service (QoS) classes, see the table below:\n\n\n| QoS        | Summary| Description |\n| ---------- | ------- | ------- |\n| _Guaranteed_ | _CPU/Mem ```requests``` = CPU/Mem ```limits```_    | _When the CPU and memory  ```requests``` and ```limits``` values are equal, the pod is given a QoS class of Guaranteed. This level of service is recommended for Splunk Enterprise ___production environments___._ |\n| _Burstable_ | _CPU/Mem ```requests``` < CPU/Mem ```limits```_  | _When the CPU and memory  ```requests``` value is set lower than the ```limits``` the pod is given a QoS class of Burstable. This level of service is useful in a user acceptance testing ___(UAT) environment___, where the pods run with minimum resources, and Kubernetes allocates additional resources depending on usage._|\n| _BestEffort_ | _No CPU/Mem ```requests``` or ```limits``` are set_ | _When the ```requests``` or ```limits``` values are not set, the pod is given a QoS class of BestEffort. This level of service is sufficient for ___testing, or a small development task___._ |\n\nExamples on how to implement these QoS are given at [Examples of Guaranteed and Burstable QoS](CustomResources.md#examples-of-guaranteed-and-burstable-qos) section.\n\n\n### Storage guidelines\nThe Splunk Operator uses Kubernetes [Persistent Volume Claims](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/persistent-volumes/#persistentvolumeclaims) to store all of your Splunk Enterprise configuration (\"$SPLUNK_HOME/etc\" path) and event (\"$SPLUNK_HOME/var\" path) data. If one of the underlying machines fail, Kubernetes will automatically try to recover by restarting the Splunk Enterprise pods on another machine that is able to reuse the same data volumes. This minimizes the maintenance burden on your operations team by reducing the impact of common hardware failures to the equivalent of a service restart. \nThe use of Persistent Volume Claims requires that your cluster is configured to support one or more Kubernetes persistent [Storage Classes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/storage-classes/). See the [Setting Up a Persistent Storage for Splunk](StorageClass.md) page for more\ninformation.\n\n### What Storage Type To Use?\n\nThe Kubernetes infrastructure must have access to storage that meets or exceeds the recommendations provided in the Splunk Enterprise storage type recommendations at [Reference Hardware documentation - what storage type to use for a given role?](https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/latest/Capacity/Referencehardware#What_storage_type_should_I_use_for_a_role.3F) In summary, Indexers with SmartStore need NVMe or SSD storage to provide the necessary IOPs for a successful Splunk Enterprise environment.\n\n\n### Splunk SmartStore Required\nFor production environments, we are requiring the use of Splunk SmartStore. As a Splunk Enterprise deployment's data volume increases, demand for storage typically outpaces demand for compute resources. [Splunk's SmartStore Feature](https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/latest/Indexer/AboutSmartStore) allows you to manage your indexer storage and compute resources in a ___cost-effective___ manner by scaling those resources separately. SmartStore utilizes a fast storage cache on each indexer node to keep recent data locally available for search and keep other data in a remote object store. Look into the [SmartStore Resource Guide](SmartStore.md) document for configuring and using SmartStore through operator.\n\n## Installing the Splunk Operator\n\nA Kubernetes cluster administrator can install and start the Splunk Operator for specific namespace by running:\n```\nkubectl apply -f https://github.com/splunk/splunk-operator/releases/download/2.0.0/splunk-operator-namespace.yaml\n```\n\nA Kubernetes cluster administrator can install and start the Splunk Operator for cluster-wide by running:\n```\nkubectl apply -f https://github.com/splunk/splunk-operator/releases/download/2.0.0/splunk-operator-cluster.yaml\n```\n\nThe [Advanced Installation Instructions](Install.md) page offers guidance for advanced configurations, including the use of private image registries, installation at cluster scope, and installing the Splunk Operator as a user who is not a Kubernetes administrator. Users of Red Hat OpenShift should review the [Red Hat OpenShift](OpenShift.md) page.\n\nThe [Advanced Installation Instructions](Install.md) page offers guidance for advanced configurations, including the use of private image registries, installation at cluster scope, and installing the Splunk Operator as a user who is not a Kubernetes administrator. Users of Red Hat OpenShift should review the [Red Hat OpenShift](OpenShift.md) page.\n\n*Note: We recommended that the Splunk Enterprise Docker image is copied to a private registry, or directly onto your Kubernetes workers before creating large Splunk Enterprise deployments. See the [Required Images Documentation](Images.md) page, and the [Advanced Installation Instructions](Install.md) page for guidance on working with copies of the Docker images.*\n\nAfter the Splunk Operator starts, you'll see a single pod running within your current namespace:\n```\n$ kubectl get pods\nNAME                               READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE\nsplunk-operator-75f5d4d85b-8pshn   1/1     Running   0          5s\n```\n## Upgrading the Splunk Operator\n\nFor information on upgrading the Splunk Operator, see the [How to upgrade Splunk Operator and Splunk Enterprise Deployments](SplunkOperatorUpgrade.md) page.\n\n## Creating a Splunk Enterprise deployment\n\nThe `Standalone` custom resource is used to create a single instance deployment of Splunk Enterprise. For example:\n\n1. Run the command to create a deployment named \u201cs1\u201d:\n\n\n```yaml\ncat <<EOF | kubectl apply -n splunk-operator -f -\napiVersion: enterprise.splunk.com/v3\nkind: Standalone\nmetadata:\n  name: s1\n  finalizers:\n  - enterprise.splunk.com/delete-pvc\nEOF\n```\n\n**The `enterprise.splunk.com/delete-pvc` finalizer is optional, and tells the Splunk Operator to remove any Kubernetes [Persistent Volumes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/persistent-volumes/) associated with the instance if you delete the pod.**\n\nWithin a few minutes, you'll see new pods running in your namespace:\n\n```\n$ kubectl get pods\nNAME                                   READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE\nsplunk-operator-7c5599546c-wt4xl        1/1    Running   0          11h\nsplunk-s1-standalone-0                  1/1    Running   0          45s\n```\n\n*Note: if your shell prints a `%` at the end, leave that out when you copy the output.*\n\n2. You can use a simple network port forward to open port 8000 for Splunk Web access:\n\n```\nkubectl port-forward splunk-s1-standalone-0 8000\n```\n\n3. Get your passwords for the namespace. The Splunk Enterprise passwords used in the namespace are generated automatically. To learn how to find and read the passwords, see the [Reading global kubernetes secret object](Examples.md#reading-global-kubernetes-secret-object) page.\n\n\n4. Log into Splunk Enterprise at http://localhost:8000 using the `admin` account with the password.\n\n5. To delete your standalone deployment, run:\n\n```\nkubectl delete standalone s1\n``` \n\nThe `Standalone` custom resource is just one of the resources the Splunk Operator provides. You can find more custom resources and the parameters they support on the [Custom Resource Guide](CustomResources.md) page.\n\nFor additional deployment examples, including Splunk Enterprise clusters, see the \n[Configuring Splunk Enterprise Deployments](Examples.md) page.\n\nFor additional guidance on making Splunk Enterprise ports accessible outside of Kubernetes, see the [Configuring Ingress](Ingress.md) page.\n\n## Contacting Support\nIf you are a Splunk Enterprise customer with a valid support entitlement contract and have a Splunk-related question, you can open a support case on the https://www.splunk.com/ support portal.\"\n",

      "csv_description": "# Getting Started with the Splunk Operator for Kubernetes\nThe Splunk Operator for Kubernetes enables you to quickly and easily deploy Splunk Enterprise on your choice of private or public cloud provider. The Operator simplifies scaling and management of Splunk Enterprise by automating administrative workflows using Kubernetes best practices. \n\nThe Splunk Operator runs as a container, and uses the Kubernetes [operator pattern](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/operator/) and [custom resources](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/api-extension/custom-resources/) objects to create and manage a scalable and sustainable Splunk Enterprise environment.\n\nThis guide is intended to help new users get up and running with the\nSplunk Operator for Kubernetes. It is divided into the following sections:\n\n* [Known Issues for the Splunk Operator](#known-issues-for-the-splunk-operator)\n* [Prerequisites for the Splunk Operator](#prerequisites-for-the-splunk-operator)\n* [Installing the Splunk Operator](#installing-the-splunk-operator)\n* [Creating Splunk Enterprise Deployments](#creating-a-splunk-enterprise-deployment)\n* [Securing Splunk Deployments in Kubernetes](Security.md)\n* [Contacting Support](#contacting-support)\n\n## Support Resources\n\nSPLUNK SUPPORTED: The Splunk Operator for Kubernetes is a supported method for deploying distributed Splunk Enterprise environments using containers.\n\nCOMMUNITY DEVELOPED: Splunk Operator for Kubernetes is an open source product developed by Splunkers with contributions from the community of partners and customers. The primary reason why Splunk is taking this approach is to push product development closer to those that use and depend upon it. This direct connection will help us all be more successful and move at a rapid pace.\n\nIf you're interested in contributing to the SOK open source project, review the [Contributing to the Project](CONTRIBUTING.md) page.\n\n**Community Support & Discussions on\n[Slack](https://splunk-usergroups.slack.com)** channel #splunk-operator-for-kubernetes\n\n**File Issues or Enhancements in\n[GitHub](https://github.com/splunk/splunk-operator/issues)** splunk/splunk-operator\n\n\n## Known Issues for the Splunk Operator\n\nReview the [Change Log](ChangeLog.md) page for a history of changes in each release.\n\n## Prerequisites for the Splunk Operator\n\n### Supported Kubernetes Versions\n\n- Kubernetes, version 1.16.2+ and later (x86 64-bit only).\n\nThe Splunk Operator should work with any [CNCF certified distribution](https://www.cncf.io/certification/software-conformance/) of Kubernetes. We do not have platform recommendations, but this is a table of platforms that our developers, customers, and partners have used successfully with the Splunk Operator.\n\n<table>\n<tr><td> Splunk Development & Testing Platforms </td><td> Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS), Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) </td></tr>\n<tr><td> Customer Reported Platforms </td><td> Microsoft Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), Red Hat OpenShift </td></tr>\n<tr><td> Partner Tested Platforms</td><td> HPE Ezmeral</td></tr>\n<tr><td> Other Platforms </td><td>CNCF certified distribution</td></tr>\n</table>\n\n### Splunk Enterprise Compatibility\nEach Splunk Operator release has specific Splunk Enterprise compatibility requirements. Before installing or upgrading the Splunk Operator, review the [Change Log](ChangeLog.md) to verify version compatibility with Splunk Enterprise releases.\n\n### Splunk Apps Installation\n\nApps and add-ons can be installed using the Splunk Operator by following the instructions given at [Installing Splunk Apps](Examples.md#installing-splunk-apps).  Premium apps such as Enterprise Security and IT Service Intelligence are currently not supported.\n\n\n### Docker requirements\nThe Splunk Operator requires these docker images to be present or available to your Kubernetes cluster:\n\n* `splunk/splunk-operator`: The Splunk Operator image built by this repository or the [official release](https://hub.docker.com/r/splunk/splunk-operator) (2.0.0 or later)\n* `splunk/splunk:<version>`: The [Splunk Enterprise image](https://github.com/splunk/docker-splunk) (9.0.0 or later)\n\nAll of the Splunk Enterprise images are publicly available on [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/). If your cluster does not have access to pull from Docker Hub, see the [Required Images Documentation](Images.md) page.\n\nReview the [Change Log](ChangeLog.md) page for a history of changes and Splunk Enterprise compatibility for each release.\n\n### Hardware Resources Requirements\nThe resource guidelines for running production Splunk Enterprise instances in pods through the Splunk Operator are the same as running Splunk Enterprise natively on a supported operating system and file system. Refer to the Splunk Enterprise [Reference Hardware documentation](https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/latest/Capacity/Referencehardware) for additional details.  We would also recommend following the same guidance on [Splunk Enterprise for disabling Transparent Huge Pages (THP)](https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/latest/ReleaseNotes/SplunkandTHP) for the nodes in your Kubernetes cluster.  Please be aware that this may impact performance of other non-Splunk workloads.\n\n#### Minimum Reference Hardware\nBased on Splunk Enterprise [Reference Hardware documentation](https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/latest/Capacity/Referencehardware), a summary of the minimum reference hardware requirements is given below.\n\n| Standalone        | Search Head / Search Head Cluster | Indexer Cluster |\n| ---------- | ------- | ------- |\n| _Each Standalone Pod: 12 Physical CPU Cores or 24 vCPU at 2Ghz or greater per core, 12GB RAM._| _Each Search Head Pod: 16 Physical CPU Cores or 32 vCPU at 2Ghz or greater per core, 12GB RAM._| _Each Indexer Pod: 12 Physical CPU cores, or 24 vCPU at 2GHz or greater per core, 12GB RAM._ |\n\n\n#### _Using Kubernetes Quality of Service Classes_\n\nIn addition to the guidelines provided in the reference hardware, [Kubernetes Quality of Service Classes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/quality-service-pod/)  can be used to configure CPU/Mem resources allocations that map to your _service level objectives_. For further information on utilizing Kubernetes Quality of Service (QoS) classes, see the table below:\n\n\n| QoS        | Summary| Description |\n| ---------- | ------- | ------- |\n| _Guaranteed_ | _CPU/Mem ```requests``` = CPU/Mem ```limits```_    | _When the CPU and memory  ```requests``` and ```limits``` values are equal, the pod is given a QoS class of Guaranteed. This level of service is recommended for Splunk Enterprise ___production environments___._ |\n| _Burstable_ | _CPU/Mem ```requests``` < CPU/Mem ```limits```_  | _When the CPU and memory  ```requests``` value is set lower than the ```limits``` the pod is given a QoS class of Burstable. This level of service is useful in a user acceptance testing ___(UAT) environment___, where the pods run with minimum resources, and Kubernetes allocates additional resources depending on usage._|\n| _BestEffort_ | _No CPU/Mem ```requests``` or ```limits``` are set_ | _When the ```requests``` or ```limits``` values are not set, the pod is given a QoS class of BestEffort. This level of service is sufficient for ___testing, or a small development task___._ |\n\nExamples on how to implement these QoS are given at [Examples of Guaranteed and Burstable QoS](CustomResources.md#examples-of-guaranteed-and-burstable-qos) section.\n\n\n### Storage guidelines\nThe Splunk Operator uses Kubernetes [Persistent Volume Claims](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/persistent-volumes/#persistentvolumeclaims) to store all of your Splunk Enterprise configuration (\"$SPLUNK_HOME/etc\" path) and event (\"$SPLUNK_HOME/var\" path) data. If one of the underlying machines fail, Kubernetes will automatically try to recover by restarting the Splunk Enterprise pods on another machine that is able to reuse the same data volumes. This minimizes the maintenance burden on your operations team by reducing the impact of common hardware failures to the equivalent of a service restart. \nThe use of Persistent Volume Claims requires that your cluster is configured to support one or more Kubernetes persistent [Storage Classes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/storage-classes/). See the [Setting Up a Persistent Storage for Splunk](StorageClass.md) page for more\ninformation.\n\n### What Storage Type To Use?\n\nThe Kubernetes infrastructure must have access to storage that meets or exceeds the recommendations provided in the Splunk Enterprise storage type recommendations at [Reference Hardware documentation - what storage type to use for a given role?](https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/latest/Capacity/Referencehardware#What_storage_type_should_I_use_for_a_role.3F) In summary, Indexers with SmartStore need NVMe or SSD storage to provide the necessary IOPs for a successful Splunk Enterprise environment.\n\n\n### Splunk SmartStore Required\nFor production environments, we are requiring the use of Splunk SmartStore. As a Splunk Enterprise deployment's data volume increases, demand for storage typically outpaces demand for compute resources. [Splunk's SmartStore Feature](https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/latest/Indexer/AboutSmartStore) allows you to manage your indexer storage and compute resources in a ___cost-effective___ manner by scaling those resources separately. SmartStore utilizes a fast storage cache on each indexer node to keep recent data locally available for search and keep other data in a remote object store. Look into the [SmartStore Resource Guide](SmartStore.md) document for configuring and using SmartStore through operator.\n\n## Installing the Splunk Operator\n\nA Kubernetes cluster administrator can install and start the Splunk Operator for specific namespace by running:\n```\nkubectl apply -f https://github.com/splunk/splunk-operator/releases/download/2.0.0/splunk-operator-namespace.yaml\n```\n\nA Kubernetes cluster administrator can install and start the Splunk Operator for cluster-wide by running:\n```\nkubectl apply -f https://github.com/splunk/splunk-operator/releases/download/2.0.0/splunk-operator-cluster.yaml\n```\n\nThe [Advanced Installation Instructions](Install.md) page offers guidance for advanced configurations, including the use of private image registries, installation at cluster scope, and installing the Splunk Operator as a user who is not a Kubernetes administrator. Users of Red Hat OpenShift should review the [Red Hat OpenShift](OpenShift.md) page.\n\nThe [Advanced Installation Instructions](Install.md) page offers guidance for advanced configurations, including the use of private image registries, installation at cluster scope, and installing the Splunk Operator as a user who is not a Kubernetes administrator. Users of Red Hat OpenShift should review the [Red Hat OpenShift](OpenShift.md) page.\n\n*Note: We recommended that the Splunk Enterprise Docker image is copied to a private registry, or directly onto your Kubernetes workers before creating large Splunk Enterprise deployments. See the [Required Images Documentation](Images.md) page, and the [Advanced Installation Instructions](Install.md) page for guidance on working with copies of the Docker images.*\n\nAfter the Splunk Operator starts, you'll see a single pod running within your current namespace:\n```\n$ kubectl get pods\nNAME                               READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE\nsplunk-operator-75f5d4d85b-8pshn   1/1     Running   0          5s\n```\n## Upgrading the Splunk Operator\n\nFor information on upgrading the Splunk Operator, see the [How to upgrade Splunk Operator and Splunk Enterprise Deployments](SplunkOperatorUpgrade.md) page.\n\n## Creating a Splunk Enterprise deployment\n\nThe `Standalone` custom resource is used to create a single instance deployment of Splunk Enterprise. For example:\n\n1. Run the command to create a deployment named \u201cs1\u201d:\n\n\n```yaml\ncat <<EOF | kubectl apply -n splunk-operator -f -\napiVersion: enterprise.splunk.com/v3\nkind: Standalone\nmetadata:\n  name: s1\n  finalizers:\n  - enterprise.splunk.com/delete-pvc\nEOF\n```\n\n**The `enterprise.splunk.com/delete-pvc` finalizer is optional, and tells the Splunk Operator to remove any Kubernetes [Persistent Volumes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/persistent-volumes/) associated with the instance if you delete the pod.**\n\nWithin a few minutes, you'll see new pods running in your namespace:\n\n```\n$ kubectl get pods\nNAME                                   READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE\nsplunk-operator-7c5599546c-wt4xl        1/1    Running   0          11h\nsplunk-s1-standalone-0                  1/1    Running   0          45s\n```\n\n*Note: if your shell prints a `%` at the end, leave that out when you copy the output.*\n\n2. You can use a simple network port forward to open port 8000 for Splunk Web access:\n\n```\nkubectl port-forward splunk-s1-standalone-0 8000\n```\n\n3. Get your passwords for the namespace. The Splunk Enterprise passwords used in the namespace are generated automatically. To learn how to find and read the passwords, see the [Reading global kubernetes secret object](Examples.md#reading-global-kubernetes-secret-object) page.\n\n\n4. Log into Splunk Enterprise at http://localhost:8000 using the `admin` account with the password.\n\n5. To delete your standalone deployment, run:\n\n```\nkubectl delete standalone s1\n``` \n\nThe `Standalone` custom resource is just one of the resources the Splunk Operator provides. You can find more custom resources and the parameters they support on the [Custom Resource Guide](CustomResources.md) page.\n\nFor additional deployment examples, including Splunk Enterprise clusters, see the \n[Configuring Splunk Enterprise Deployments](Examples.md) page.\n\nFor additional guidance on making Splunk Enterprise ports accessible outside of Kubernetes, see the [Configuring Ingress](Ingress.md) page.\n\n## Contacting Support\nIf you are a Splunk Enterprise customer with a valid support entitlement contract and have a Splunk-related question, you can open a support case on the https://www.splunk.com/ support portal.\"\n",

      "csv_description": "# Getting Started with the Splunk Operator for Kubernetes\nThe Splunk Operator for Kubernetes enables you to quickly and easily deploy Splunk Enterprise on your choice of private or public cloud provider. The Operator simplifies scaling and management of Splunk Enterprise by automating administrative workflows using Kubernetes best practices. \n\nThe Splunk Operator runs as a container, and uses the Kubernetes [operator pattern](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/operator/) and [custom resources](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/api-extension/custom-resources/) objects to create and manage a scalable and sustainable Splunk Enterprise environment.\n\nThis guide is intended to help new users get up and running with the\nSplunk Operator for Kubernetes. It is divided into the following sections:\n\n* [Known Issues for the Splunk Operator](#known-issues-for-the-splunk-operator)\n* [Prerequisites for the Splunk Operator](#prerequisites-for-the-splunk-operator)\n* [Installing the Splunk Operator](#installing-the-splunk-operator)\n* [Creating Splunk Enterprise Deployments](#creating-a-splunk-enterprise-deployment)\n* [Securing Splunk Deployments in Kubernetes](Security.md)\n* [Contacting Support](#contacting-support)\n\n## Support Resources\n\nSPLUNK SUPPORTED: The Splunk Operator for Kubernetes is a supported method for deploying distributed Splunk Enterprise environments using containers.\n\nCOMMUNITY DEVELOPED: Splunk Operator for Kubernetes is an open source product developed by Splunkers with contributions from the community of partners and customers. The primary reason why Splunk is taking this approach is to push product development closer to those that use and depend upon it. This direct connection will help us all be more successful and move at a rapid pace.\n\nIf you're interested in contributing to the SOK open source project, review the [Contributing to the Project](CONTRIBUTING.md) page.\n\n**Community Support & Discussions on\n[Slack](https://splunk-usergroups.slack.com)** channel #splunk-operator-for-kubernetes\n\n**File Issues or Enhancements in\n[GitHub](https://github.com/splunk/splunk-operator/issues)** splunk/splunk-operator\n\n\n## Known Issues for the Splunk Operator\n\nReview the [Change Log](ChangeLog.md) page for a history of changes in each release.\n\n## Prerequisites for the Splunk Operator\n\n### Supported Kubernetes Versions\n\n- Kubernetes, version 1.16.2+ and later (x86 64-bit only).\n\nThe Splunk Operator should work with any [CNCF certified distribution](https://www.cncf.io/certification/software-conformance/) of Kubernetes. We do not have platform recommendations, but this is a table of platforms that our developers, customers, and partners have used successfully with the Splunk Operator.\n\n<table>\n<tr><td> Splunk Development & Testing Platforms </td><td> Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS), Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) </td></tr>\n<tr><td> Customer Reported Platforms </td><td> Microsoft Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), Red Hat OpenShift </td></tr>\n<tr><td> Partner Tested Platforms</td><td> HPE Ezmeral</td></tr>\n<tr><td> Other Platforms </td><td>CNCF certified distribution</td></tr>\n</table>\n\n### Splunk Enterprise Compatibility\nEach Splunk Operator release has specific Splunk Enterprise compatibility requirements. Before installing or upgrading the Splunk Operator, review the [Change Log](ChangeLog.md) to verify version compatibility with Splunk Enterprise releases.\n\n### Splunk Apps Installation\n\nApps and add-ons can be installed using the Splunk Operator by following the instructions given at [Installing Splunk Apps](Examples.md#installing-splunk-apps).  Premium apps such as Enterprise Security and IT Service Intelligence are currently not supported.\n\n\n### Docker requirements\nThe Splunk Operator requires these docker images to be present or available to your Kubernetes cluster:\n\n* `splunk/splunk-operator`: The Splunk Operator image built by this repository or the [official release](https://hub.docker.com/r/splunk/splunk-operator) (2.0.0 or later)\n* `splunk/splunk:<version>`: The [Splunk Enterprise image](https://github.com/splunk/docker-splunk) (9.0.0 or later)\n\nAll of the Splunk Enterprise images are publicly available on [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/). If your cluster does not have access to pull from Docker Hub, see the [Required Images Documentation](Images.md) page.\n\nReview the [Change Log](ChangeLog.md) page for a history of changes and Splunk Enterprise compatibility for each release.\n\n### Hardware Resources Requirements\nThe resource guidelines for running production Splunk Enterprise instances in pods through the Splunk Operator are the same as running Splunk Enterprise natively on a supported operating system and file system. Refer to the Splunk Enterprise [Reference Hardware documentation](https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/latest/Capacity/Referencehardware) for additional details.  We would also recommend following the same guidance on [Splunk Enterprise for disabling Transparent Huge Pages (THP)](https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/latest/ReleaseNotes/SplunkandTHP) for the nodes in your Kubernetes cluster.  Please be aware that this may impact performance of other non-Splunk workloads.\n\n#### Minimum Reference Hardware\nBased on Splunk Enterprise [Reference Hardware documentation](https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/latest/Capacity/Referencehardware), a summary of the minimum reference hardware requirements is given below.\n\n| Standalone        | Search Head / Search Head Cluster | Indexer Cluster |\n| ---------- | ------- | ------- |\n| _Each Standalone Pod: 12 Physical CPU Cores or 24 vCPU at 2Ghz or greater per core, 12GB RAM._| _Each Search Head Pod: 16 Physical CPU Cores or 32 vCPU at 2Ghz or greater per core, 12GB RAM._| _Each Indexer Pod: 12 Physical CPU cores, or 24 vCPU at 2GHz or greater per core, 12GB RAM._ |\n\n\n#### _Using Kubernetes Quality of Service Classes_\n\nIn addition to the guidelines provided in the reference hardware, [Kubernetes Quality of Service Classes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/quality-service-pod/)  can be used to configure CPU/Mem resources allocations that map to your _service level objectives_. For further information on utilizing Kubernetes Quality of Service (QoS) classes, see the table below:\n\n\n| QoS        | Summary| Description |\n| ---------- | ------- | ------- |\n| _Guaranteed_ | _CPU/Mem ```requests``` = CPU/Mem ```limits```_    | _When the CPU and memory  ```requests``` and ```limits``` values are equal, the pod is given a QoS class of Guaranteed. This level of service is recommended for Splunk Enterprise ___production environments___._ |\n| _Burstable_ | _CPU/Mem ```requests``` < CPU/Mem ```limits```_  | _When the CPU and memory  ```requests``` value is set lower than the ```limits``` the pod is given a QoS class of Burstable. This level of service is useful in a user acceptance testing ___(UAT) environment___, where the pods run with minimum resources, and Kubernetes allocates additional resources depending on usage._|\n| _BestEffort_ | _No CPU/Mem ```requests``` or ```limits``` are set_ | _When the ```requests``` or ```limits``` values are not set, the pod is given a QoS class of BestEffort. This level of service is sufficient for ___testing, or a small development task___._ |\n\nExamples on how to implement these QoS are given at [Examples of Guaranteed and Burstable QoS](CustomResources.md#examples-of-guaranteed-and-burstable-qos) section.\n\n\n### Storage guidelines\nThe Splunk Operator uses Kubernetes [Persistent Volume Claims](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/persistent-volumes/#persistentvolumeclaims) to store all of your Splunk Enterprise configuration (\"$SPLUNK_HOME/etc\" path) and event (\"$SPLUNK_HOME/var\" path) data. If one of the underlying machines fail, Kubernetes will automatically try to recover by restarting the Splunk Enterprise pods on another machine that is able to reuse the same data volumes. This minimizes the maintenance burden on your operations team by reducing the impact of common hardware failures to the equivalent of a service restart. \nThe use of Persistent Volume Claims requires that your cluster is configured to support one or more Kubernetes persistent [Storage Classes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/storage-classes/). See the [Setting Up a Persistent Storage for Splunk](StorageClass.md) page for more\ninformation.\n\n### What Storage Type To Use?\n\nThe Kubernetes infrastructure must have access to storage that meets or exceeds the recommendations provided in the Splunk Enterprise storage type recommendations at [Reference Hardware documentation - what storage type to use for a given role?](https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/latest/Capacity/Referencehardware#What_storage_type_should_I_use_for_a_role.3F) In summary, Indexers with SmartStore need NVMe or SSD storage to provide the necessary IOPs for a successful Splunk Enterprise environment.\n\n\n### Splunk SmartStore Required\nFor production environments, we are requiring the use of Splunk SmartStore. As a Splunk Enterprise deployment's data volume increases, demand for storage typically outpaces demand for compute resources. [Splunk's SmartStore Feature](https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/latest/Indexer/AboutSmartStore) allows you to manage your indexer storage and compute resources in a ___cost-effective___ manner by scaling those resources separately. SmartStore utilizes a fast storage cache on each indexer node to keep recent data locally available for search and keep other data in a remote object store. Look into the [SmartStore Resource Guide](SmartStore.md) document for configuring and using SmartStore through operator.\n\n## Installing the Splunk Operator\n\nA Kubernetes cluster administrator can install and start the Splunk Operator for specific namespace by running:\n```\nkubectl apply -f https://github.com/splunk/splunk-operator/releases/download/2.0.0/splunk-operator-namespace.yaml\n```\n\nA Kubernetes cluster administrator can install and start the Splunk Operator for cluster-wide by running:\n```\nkubectl apply -f https://github.com/splunk/splunk-operator/releases/download/2.0.0/splunk-operator-cluster.yaml\n```\n\nThe [Advanced Installation Instructions](Install.md) page offers guidance for advanced configurations, including the use of private image registries, installation at cluster scope, and installing the Splunk Operator as a user who is not a Kubernetes administrator. Users of Red Hat OpenShift should review the [Red Hat OpenShift](OpenShift.md) page.\n\nThe [Advanced Installation Instructions](Install.md) page offers guidance for advanced configurations, including the use of private image registries, installation at cluster scope, and installing the Splunk Operator as a user who is not a Kubernetes administrator. Users of Red Hat OpenShift should review the [Red Hat OpenShift](OpenShift.md) page.\n\n*Note: We recommended that the Splunk Enterprise Docker image is copied to a private registry, or directly onto your Kubernetes workers before creating large Splunk Enterprise deployments. See the [Required Images Documentation](Images.md) page, and the [Advanced Installation Instructions](Install.md) page for guidance on working with copies of the Docker images.*\n\nAfter the Splunk Operator starts, you'll see a single pod running within your current namespace:\n```\n$ kubectl get pods\nNAME                               READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE\nsplunk-operator-75f5d4d85b-8pshn   1/1     Running   0          5s\n```\n## Upgrading the Splunk Operator\n\nFor information on upgrading the Splunk Operator, see the [How to upgrade Splunk Operator and Splunk Enterprise Deployments](SplunkOperatorUpgrade.md) page.\n\n## Creating a Splunk Enterprise deployment\n\nThe `Standalone` custom resource is used to create a single instance deployment of Splunk Enterprise. For example:\n\n1. Run the command to create a deployment named \u201cs1\u201d:\n\n\n```yaml\ncat <<EOF | kubectl apply -n splunk-operator -f -\napiVersion: enterprise.splunk.com/v3\nkind: Standalone\nmetadata:\n  name: s1\n  finalizers:\n  - enterprise.splunk.com/delete-pvc\nEOF\n```\n\n**The `enterprise.splunk.com/delete-pvc` finalizer is optional, and tells the Splunk Operator to remove any Kubernetes [Persistent Volumes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/persistent-volumes/) associated with the instance if you delete the pod.**\n\nWithin a few minutes, you'll see new pods running in your namespace:\n\n```\n$ kubectl get pods\nNAME                                   READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE\nsplunk-operator-7c5599546c-wt4xl        1/1    Running   0          11h\nsplunk-s1-standalone-0                  1/1    Running   0          45s\n```\n\n*Note: if your shell prints a `%` at the end, leave that out when you copy the output.*\n\n2. You can use a simple network port forward to open port 8000 for Splunk Web access:\n\n```\nkubectl port-forward splunk-s1-standalone-0 8000\n```\n\n3. Get your passwords for the namespace. The Splunk Enterprise passwords used in the namespace are generated automatically. To learn how to find and read the passwords, see the [Reading global kubernetes secret object](Examples.md#reading-global-kubernetes-secret-object) page.\n\n\n4. Log into Splunk Enterprise at http://localhost:8000 using the `admin` account with the password.\n\n5. To delete your standalone deployment, run:\n\n```\nkubectl delete standalone s1\n``` \n\nThe `Standalone` custom resource is just one of the resources the Splunk Operator provides. You can find more custom resources and the parameters they support on the [Custom Resource Guide](CustomResources.md) page.\n\nFor additional deployment examples, including Splunk Enterprise clusters, see the \n[Configuring Splunk Enterprise Deployments](Examples.md) page.\n\nFor additional guidance on making Splunk Enterprise ports accessible outside of Kubernetes, see the [Configuring Ingress](Ingress.md) page.\n\n## Contacting Support\nIf you are a Splunk Enterprise customer with a valid support entitlement contract and have a Splunk-related question, you can open a support case on the https://www.splunk.com/ support portal.\"\n",

      "csv_description": "# Getting Started with the Splunk Operator for Kubernetes\nThe Splunk Operator for Kubernetes enables you to quickly and easily deploy Splunk Enterprise on your choice of private or public cloud provider. The Operator simplifies scaling and management of Splunk Enterprise by automating administrative workflows using Kubernetes best practices. \n\nThe Splunk Operator runs as a container, and uses the Kubernetes [operator pattern](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/operator/) and [custom resources](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/api-extension/custom-resources/) objects to create and manage a scalable and sustainable Splunk Enterprise environment.\n\nThis guide is intended to help new users get up and running with the\nSplunk Operator for Kubernetes. It is divided into the following sections:\n\n* [Known Issues for the Splunk Operator](#known-issues-for-the-splunk-operator)\n* [Prerequisites for the Splunk Operator](#prerequisites-for-the-splunk-operator)\n* [Installing the Splunk Operator](#installing-the-splunk-operator)\n* [Creating Splunk Enterprise Deployments](#creating-a-splunk-enterprise-deployment)\n* [Securing Splunk Deployments in Kubernetes](Security.md)\n* [Contacting Support](#contacting-support)\n\n## Support Resources\n\nSPLUNK SUPPORTED: The Splunk Operator for Kubernetes is a supported method for deploying distributed Splunk Enterprise environments using containers.\n\nCOMMUNITY DEVELOPED: Splunk Operator for Kubernetes is an open source product developed by Splunkers with contributions from the community of partners and customers. The primary reason why Splunk is taking this approach is to push product development closer to those that use and depend upon it. This direct connection will help us all be more successful and move at a rapid pace.\n\nIf you're interested in contributing to the SOK open source project, review the [Contributing to the Project](CONTRIBUTING.md) page.\n\n**Community Support & Discussions on\n[Slack](https://splunk-usergroups.slack.com)** channel #splunk-operator-for-kubernetes\n\n**File Issues or Enhancements in\n[GitHub](https://github.com/splunk/splunk-operator/issues)** splunk/splunk-operator\n\n\n## Known Issues for the Splunk Operator\n\nReview the [Change Log](ChangeLog.md) page for a history of changes in each release.\n\n## Prerequisites for the Splunk Operator\n\n### Supported Kubernetes Versions\n\n- Kubernetes, version 1.16.2+ and later (x86 64-bit only).\n\nThe Splunk Operator should work with any [CNCF certified distribution](https://www.cncf.io/certification/software-conformance/) of Kubernetes. We do not have platform recommendations, but this is a table of platforms that our developers, customers, and partners have used successfully with the Splunk Operator.\n\n<table>\n<tr><td> Splunk Development & Testing Platforms </td><td> Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS), Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) </td></tr>\n<tr><td> Customer Reported Platforms </td><td> Microsoft Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), Red Hat OpenShift </td></tr>\n<tr><td> Partner Tested Platforms</td><td> HPE Ezmeral</td></tr>\n<tr><td> Other Platforms </td><td>CNCF certified distribution</td></tr>\n</table>\n\n### Splunk Enterprise Compatibility\nEach Splunk Operator release has specific Splunk Enterprise compatibility requirements. Before installing or upgrading the Splunk Operator, review the [Change Log](ChangeLog.md) to verify version compatibility with Splunk Enterprise releases.\n\n### Splunk Apps Installation\n\nApps and add-ons can be installed using the Splunk Operator by following the instructions given at [Installing Splunk Apps](Examples.md#installing-splunk-apps).  Premium apps such as Enterprise Security and IT Service Intelligence are currently not supported.\n\n\n### Docker requirements\nThe Splunk Operator requires these docker images to be present or available to your Kubernetes cluster:\n\n* `splunk/splunk-operator`: The Splunk Operator image built by this repository or the [official release](https://hub.docker.com/r/splunk/splunk-operator) (2.0.0 or later)\n* `splunk/splunk:<version>`: The [Splunk Enterprise image](https://github.com/splunk/docker-splunk) (9.0.0 or later)\n\nAll of the Splunk Enterprise images are publicly available on [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/). If your cluster does not have access to pull from Docker Hub, see the [Required Images Documentation](Images.md) page.\n\nReview the [Change Log](ChangeLog.md) page for a history of changes and Splunk Enterprise compatibility for each release.\n\n### Hardware Resources Requirements\nThe resource guidelines for running production Splunk Enterprise instances in pods through the Splunk Operator are the same as running Splunk Enterprise natively on a supported operating system and file system. Refer to the Splunk Enterprise [Reference Hardware documentation](https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/latest/Capacity/Referencehardware) for additional details.  We would also recommend following the same guidance on [Splunk Enterprise for disabling Transparent Huge Pages (THP)](https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/latest/ReleaseNotes/SplunkandTHP) for the nodes in your Kubernetes cluster.  Please be aware that this may impact performance of other non-Splunk workloads.\n\n#### Minimum Reference Hardware\nBased on Splunk Enterprise [Reference Hardware documentation](https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/latest/Capacity/Referencehardware), a summary of the minimum reference hardware requirements is given below.\n\n| Standalone        | Search Head / Search Head Cluster | Indexer Cluster |\n| ---------- | ------- | ------- |\n| _Each Standalone Pod: 12 Physical CPU Cores or 24 vCPU at 2Ghz or greater per core, 12GB RAM._| _Each Search Head Pod: 16 Physical CPU Cores or 32 vCPU at 2Ghz or greater per core, 12GB RAM._| _Each Indexer Pod: 12 Physical CPU cores, or 24 vCPU at 2GHz or greater per core, 12GB RAM._ |\n\n\n#### _Using Kubernetes Quality of Service Classes_\n\nIn addition to the guidelines provided in the reference hardware, [Kubernetes Quality of Service Classes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/quality-service-pod/)  can be used to configure CPU/Mem resources allocations that map to your _service level objectives_. For further information on utilizing Kubernetes Quality of Service (QoS) classes, see the table below:\n\n\n| QoS        | Summary| Description |\n| ---------- | ------- | ------- |\n| _Guaranteed_ | _CPU/Mem ```requests``` = CPU/Mem ```limits```_    | _When the CPU and memory  ```requests``` and ```limits``` values are equal, the pod is given a QoS class of Guaranteed. This level of service is recommended for Splunk Enterprise ___production environments___._ |\n| _Burstable_ | _CPU/Mem ```requests``` < CPU/Mem ```limits```_  | _When the CPU and memory  ```requests``` value is set lower than the ```limits``` the pod is given a QoS class of Burstable. This level of service is useful in a user acceptance testing ___(UAT) environment___, where the pods run with minimum resources, and Kubernetes allocates additional resources depending on usage._|\n| _BestEffort_ | _No CPU/Mem ```requests``` or ```limits``` are set_ | _When the ```requests``` or ```limits``` values are not set, the pod is given a QoS class of BestEffort. This level of service is sufficient for ___testing, or a small development task___._ |\n\nExamples on how to implement these QoS are given at [Examples of Guaranteed and Burstable QoS](CustomResources.md#examples-of-guaranteed-and-burstable-qos) section.\n\n\n### Storage guidelines\nThe Splunk Operator uses Kubernetes [Persistent Volume Claims](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/persistent-volumes/#persistentvolumeclaims) to store all of your Splunk Enterprise configuration (\"$SPLUNK_HOME/etc\" path) and event (\"$SPLUNK_HOME/var\" path) data. If one of the underlying machines fail, Kubernetes will automatically try to recover by restarting the Splunk Enterprise pods on another machine that is able to reuse the same data volumes. This minimizes the maintenance burden on your operations team by reducing the impact of common hardware failures to the equivalent of a service restart. \nThe use of Persistent Volume Claims requires that your cluster is configured to support one or more Kubernetes persistent [Storage Classes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/storage-classes/). See the [Setting Up a Persistent Storage for Splunk](StorageClass.md) page for more\ninformation.\n\n### What Storage Type To Use?\n\nThe Kubernetes infrastructure must have access to storage that meets or exceeds the recommendations provided in the Splunk Enterprise storage type recommendations at [Reference Hardware documentation - what storage type to use for a given role?](https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/latest/Capacity/Referencehardware#What_storage_type_should_I_use_for_a_role.3F) In summary, Indexers with SmartStore need NVMe or SSD storage to provide the necessary IOPs for a successful Splunk Enterprise environment.\n\n\n### Splunk SmartStore Required\nFor production environments, we are requiring the use of Splunk SmartStore. As a Splunk Enterprise deployment's data volume increases, demand for storage typically outpaces demand for compute resources. [Splunk's SmartStore Feature](https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/latest/Indexer/AboutSmartStore) allows you to manage your indexer storage and compute resources in a ___cost-effective___ manner by scaling those resources separately. SmartStore utilizes a fast storage cache on each indexer node to keep recent data locally available for search and keep other data in a remote object store. Look into the [SmartStore Resource Guide](SmartStore.md) document for configuring and using SmartStore through operator.\n\n## Installing the Splunk Operator\n\nA Kubernetes cluster administrator can install and start the Splunk Operator for specific namespace by running:\n```\nkubectl apply -f https://github.com/splunk/splunk-operator/releases/download/2.0.0/splunk-operator-namespace.yaml\n```\n\nA Kubernetes cluster administrator can install and start the Splunk Operator for cluster-wide by running:\n```\nkubectl apply -f https://github.com/splunk/splunk-operator/releases/download/2.0.0/splunk-operator-cluster.yaml\n```\n\nThe [Advanced Installation Instructions](Install.md) page offers guidance for advanced configurations, including the use of private image registries, installation at cluster scope, and installing the Splunk Operator as a user who is not a Kubernetes administrator. Users of Red Hat OpenShift should review the [Red Hat OpenShift](OpenShift.md) page.\n\nThe [Advanced Installation Instructions](Install.md) page offers guidance for advanced configurations, including the use of private image registries, installation at cluster scope, and installing the Splunk Operator as a user who is not a Kubernetes administrator. Users of Red Hat OpenShift should review the [Red Hat OpenShift](OpenShift.md) page.\n\n*Note: We recommended that the Splunk Enterprise Docker image is copied to a private registry, or directly onto your Kubernetes workers before creating large Splunk Enterprise deployments. See the [Required Images Documentation](Images.md) page, and the [Advanced Installation Instructions](Install.md) page for guidance on working with copies of the Docker images.*\n\nAfter the Splunk Operator starts, you'll see a single pod running within your current namespace:\n```\n$ kubectl get pods\nNAME                               READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE\nsplunk-operator-75f5d4d85b-8pshn   1/1     Running   0          5s\n```\n## Upgrading the Splunk Operator\n\nFor information on upgrading the Splunk Operator, see the [How to upgrade Splunk Operator and Splunk Enterprise Deployments](SplunkOperatorUpgrade.md) page.\n\n## Creating a Splunk Enterprise deployment\n\nThe `Standalone` custom resource is used to create a single instance deployment of Splunk Enterprise. For example:\n\n1. Run the command to create a deployment named \u201cs1\u201d:\n\n\n```yaml\ncat <<EOF | kubectl apply -n splunk-operator -f -\napiVersion: enterprise.splunk.com/v3\nkind: Standalone\nmetadata:\n  name: s1\n  finalizers:\n  - enterprise.splunk.com/delete-pvc\nEOF\n```\n\n**The `enterprise.splunk.com/delete-pvc` finalizer is optional, and tells the Splunk Operator to remove any Kubernetes [Persistent Volumes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/persistent-volumes/) associated with the instance if you delete the pod.**\n\nWithin a few minutes, you'll see new pods running in your namespace:\n\n```\n$ kubectl get pods\nNAME                                   READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE\nsplunk-operator-7c5599546c-wt4xl        1/1    Running   0          11h\nsplunk-s1-standalone-0                  1/1    Running   0          45s\n```\n\n*Note: if your shell prints a `%` at the end, leave that out when you copy the output.*\n\n2. You can use a simple network port forward to open port 8000 for Splunk Web access:\n\n```\nkubectl port-forward splunk-s1-standalone-0 8000\n```\n\n3. Get your passwords for the namespace. The Splunk Enterprise passwords used in the namespace are generated automatically. To learn how to find and read the passwords, see the [Reading global kubernetes secret object](Examples.md#reading-global-kubernetes-secret-object) page.\n\n\n4. Log into Splunk Enterprise at http://localhost:8000 using the `admin` account with the password.\n\n5. To delete your standalone deployment, run:\n\n```\nkubectl delete standalone s1\n``` \n\nThe `Standalone` custom resource is just one of the resources the Splunk Operator provides. You can find more custom resources and the parameters they support on the [Custom Resource Guide](CustomResources.md) page.\n\nFor additional deployment examples, including Splunk Enterprise clusters, see the \n[Configuring Splunk Enterprise Deployments](Examples.md) page.\n\nFor additional guidance on making Splunk Enterprise ports accessible outside of Kubernetes, see the [Configuring Ingress](Ingress.md) page.\n\n## Contacting Support\nIf you are a Splunk Enterprise customer with a valid support entitlement contract and have a Splunk-related question, you can open a support case on the https://www.splunk.com/ support portal.\"\n",

      "csv_description": "# Getting Started with the Splunk Operator for Kubernetes\nThe Splunk Operator for Kubernetes enables you to quickly and easily deploy Splunk Enterprise on your choice of private or public cloud provider. The Operator simplifies scaling and management of Splunk Enterprise by automating administrative workflows using Kubernetes best practices. \n\nThe Splunk Operator runs as a container, and uses the Kubernetes [operator pattern](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/operator/) and [custom resources](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/api-extension/custom-resources/) objects to create and manage a scalable and sustainable Splunk Enterprise environment.\n\nThis guide is intended to help new users get up and running with the\nSplunk Operator for Kubernetes. It is divided into the following sections:\n\n* [Known Issues for the Splunk Operator](#known-issues-for-the-splunk-operator)\n* [Prerequisites for the Splunk Operator](#prerequisites-for-the-splunk-operator)\n* [Installing the Splunk Operator](#installing-the-splunk-operator)\n* [Creating Splunk Enterprise Deployments](#creating-a-splunk-enterprise-deployment)\n* [Securing Splunk Deployments in Kubernetes](Security.md)\n* [Contacting Support](#contacting-support)\n\n## Support Resources\n\nSPLUNK SUPPORTED: The Splunk Operator for Kubernetes is a supported method for deploying distributed Splunk Enterprise environments using containers.\n\nCOMMUNITY DEVELOPED: Splunk Operator for Kubernetes is an open source product developed by Splunkers with contributions from the community of partners and customers. The primary reason why Splunk is taking this approach is to push product development closer to those that use and depend upon it. This direct connection will help us all be more successful and move at a rapid pace.\n\nIf you're interested in contributing to the SOK open source project, review the [Contributing to the Project](CONTRIBUTING.md) page.\n\n**Community Support & Discussions on\n[Slack](https://splunk-usergroups.slack.com)** channel #splunk-operator-for-kubernetes\n\n**File Issues or Enhancements in\n[GitHub](https://github.com/splunk/splunk-operator/issues)** splunk/splunk-operator\n\n\n## Known Issues for the Splunk Operator\n\nReview the [Change Log](ChangeLog.md) page for a history of changes in each release.\n\n## Prerequisites for the Splunk Operator\n\n### Supported Kubernetes Versions\n\n- Kubernetes, version 1.16.2+ and later (x86 64-bit only).\n\nThe Splunk Operator should work with any [CNCF certified distribution](https://www.cncf.io/certification/software-conformance/) of Kubernetes. We do not have platform recommendations, but this is a table of platforms that our developers, customers, and partners have used successfully with the Splunk Operator.\n\n<table>\n<tr><td> Splunk Development & Testing Platforms </td><td> Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS), Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) </td></tr>\n<tr><td> Customer Reported Platforms </td><td> Microsoft Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), Red Hat OpenShift </td></tr>\n<tr><td> Partner Tested Platforms</td><td> HPE Ezmeral</td></tr>\n<tr><td> Other Platforms </td><td>CNCF certified distribution</td></tr>\n</table>\n\n### Splunk Enterprise Compatibility\nEach Splunk Operator release has specific Splunk Enterprise compatibility requirements. Before installing or upgrading the Splunk Operator, review the [Change Log](ChangeLog.md) to verify version compatibility with Splunk Enterprise releases.\n\n### Splunk Apps Installation\n\nApps and add-ons can be installed using the Splunk Operator by following the instructions given at [Installing Splunk Apps](Examples.md#installing-splunk-apps).  Premium apps such as Enterprise Security and IT Service Intelligence are currently not supported.\n\n\n### Docker requirements\nThe Splunk Operator requires these docker images to be present or available to your Kubernetes cluster:\n\n* `splunk/splunk-operator`: The Splunk Operator image built by this repository or the [official release](https://hub.docker.com/r/splunk/splunk-operator) (2.0.0 or later)\n* `splunk/splunk:<version>`: The [Splunk Enterprise image](https://github.com/splunk/docker-splunk) (9.0.0 or later)\n\nAll of the Splunk Enterprise images are publicly available on [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/). If your cluster does not have access to pull from Docker Hub, see the [Required Images Documentation](Images.md) page.\n\nReview the [Change Log](ChangeLog.md) page for a history of changes and Splunk Enterprise compatibility for each release.\n\n### Hardware Resources Requirements\nThe resource guidelines for running production Splunk Enterprise instances in pods through the Splunk Operator are the same as running Splunk Enterprise natively on a supported operating system and file system. Refer to the Splunk Enterprise [Reference Hardware documentation](https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/latest/Capacity/Referencehardware) for additional details.  We would also recommend following the same guidance on [Splunk Enterprise for disabling Transparent Huge Pages (THP)](https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/latest/ReleaseNotes/SplunkandTHP) for the nodes in your Kubernetes cluster.  Please be aware that this may impact performance of other non-Splunk workloads.\n\n#### Minimum Reference Hardware\nBased on Splunk Enterprise [Reference Hardware documentation](https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/latest/Capacity/Referencehardware), a summary of the minimum reference hardware requirements is given below.\n\n| Standalone        | Search Head / Search Head Cluster | Indexer Cluster |\n| ---------- | ------- | ------- |\n| _Each Standalone Pod: 12 Physical CPU Cores or 24 vCPU at 2Ghz or greater per core, 12GB RAM._| _Each Search Head Pod: 16 Physical CPU Cores or 32 vCPU at 2Ghz or greater per core, 12GB RAM._| _Each Indexer Pod: 12 Physical CPU cores, or 24 vCPU at 2GHz or greater per core, 12GB RAM._ |\n\n\n#### _Using Kubernetes Quality of Service Classes_\n\nIn addition to the guidelines provided in the reference hardware, [Kubernetes Quality of Service Classes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/quality-service-pod/)  can be used to configure CPU/Mem resources allocations that map to your _service level objectives_. For further information on utilizing Kubernetes Quality of Service (QoS) classes, see the table below:\n\n\n| QoS        | Summary| Description |\n| ---------- | ------- | ------- |\n| _Guaranteed_ | _CPU/Mem ```requests``` = CPU/Mem ```limits```_    | _When the CPU and memory  ```requests``` and ```limits``` values are equal, the pod is given a QoS class of Guaranteed. This level of service is recommended for Splunk Enterprise ___production environments___._ |\n| _Burstable_ | _CPU/Mem ```requests``` < CPU/Mem ```limits```_  | _When the CPU and memory  ```requests``` value is set lower than the ```limits``` the pod is given a QoS class of Burstable. This level of service is useful in a user acceptance testing ___(UAT) environment___, where the pods run with minimum resources, and Kubernetes allocates additional resources depending on usage._|\n| _BestEffort_ | _No CPU/Mem ```requests``` or ```limits``` are set_ | _When the ```requests``` or ```limits``` values are not set, the pod is given a QoS class of BestEffort. This level of service is sufficient for ___testing, or a small development task___._ |\n\nExamples on how to implement these QoS are given at [Examples of Guaranteed and Burstable QoS](CustomResources.md#examples-of-guaranteed-and-burstable-qos) section.\n\n\n### Storage guidelines\nThe Splunk Operator uses Kubernetes [Persistent Volume Claims](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/persistent-volumes/#persistentvolumeclaims) to store all of your Splunk Enterprise configuration (\"$SPLUNK_HOME/etc\" path) and event (\"$SPLUNK_HOME/var\" path) data. If one of the underlying machines fail, Kubernetes will automatically try to recover by restarting the Splunk Enterprise pods on another machine that is able to reuse the same data volumes. This minimizes the maintenance burden on your operations team by reducing the impact of common hardware failures to the equivalent of a service restart. \nThe use of Persistent Volume Claims requires that your cluster is configured to support one or more Kubernetes persistent [Storage Classes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/storage-classes/). See the [Setting Up a Persistent Storage for Splunk](StorageClass.md) page for more\ninformation.\n\n### What Storage Type To Use?\n\nThe Kubernetes infrastructure must have access to storage that meets or exceeds the recommendations provided in the Splunk Enterprise storage type recommendations at [Reference Hardware documentation - what storage type to use for a given role?](https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/latest/Capacity/Referencehardware#What_storage_type_should_I_use_for_a_role.3F) In summary, Indexers with SmartStore need NVMe or SSD storage to provide the necessary IOPs for a successful Splunk Enterprise environment.\n\n\n### Splunk SmartStore Required\nFor production environments, we are requiring the use of Splunk SmartStore. As a Splunk Enterprise deployment's data volume increases, demand for storage typically outpaces demand for compute resources. [Splunk's SmartStore Feature](https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/latest/Indexer/AboutSmartStore) allows you to manage your indexer storage and compute resources in a ___cost-effective___ manner by scaling those resources separately. SmartStore utilizes a fast storage cache on each indexer node to keep recent data locally available for search and keep other data in a remote object store. Look into the [SmartStore Resource Guide](SmartStore.md) document for configuring and using SmartStore through operator.\n\n## Installing the Splunk Operator\n\nA Kubernetes cluster administrator can install and start the Splunk Operator for specific namespace by running:\n```\nkubectl apply -f https://github.com/splunk/splunk-operator/releases/download/2.0.0/splunk-operator-namespace.yaml\n```\n\nA Kubernetes cluster administrator can install and start the Splunk Operator for cluster-wide by running:\n```\nkubectl apply -f https://github.com/splunk/splunk-operator/releases/download/2.0.0/splunk-operator-cluster.yaml\n```\n\nThe [Advanced Installation Instructions](Install.md) page offers guidance for advanced configurations, including the use of private image registries, installation at cluster scope, and installing the Splunk Operator as a user who is not a Kubernetes administrator. Users of Red Hat OpenShift should review the [Red Hat OpenShift](OpenShift.md) page.\n\nThe [Advanced Installation Instructions](Install.md) page offers guidance for advanced configurations, including the use of private image registries, installation at cluster scope, and installing the Splunk Operator as a user who is not a Kubernetes administrator. Users of Red Hat OpenShift should review the [Red Hat OpenShift](OpenShift.md) page.\n\n*Note: We recommended that the Splunk Enterprise Docker image is copied to a private registry, or directly onto your Kubernetes workers before creating large Splunk Enterprise deployments. See the [Required Images Documentation](Images.md) page, and the [Advanced Installation Instructions](Install.md) page for guidance on working with copies of the Docker images.*\n\nAfter the Splunk Operator starts, you'll see a single pod running within your current namespace:\n```\n$ kubectl get pods\nNAME                               READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE\nsplunk-operator-75f5d4d85b-8pshn   1/1     Running   0          5s\n```\n## Upgrading the Splunk Operator\n\nFor information on upgrading the Splunk Operator, see the [How to upgrade Splunk Operator and Splunk Enterprise Deployments](SplunkOperatorUpgrade.md) page.\n\n## Creating a Splunk Enterprise deployment\n\nThe `Standalone` custom resource is used to create a single instance deployment of Splunk Enterprise. For example:\n\n1. Run the command to create a deployment named \u201cs1\u201d:\n\n\n```yaml\ncat <<EOF | kubectl apply -n splunk-operator -f -\napiVersion: enterprise.splunk.com/v3\nkind: Standalone\nmetadata:\n  name: s1\n  finalizers:\n  - enterprise.splunk.com/delete-pvc\nEOF\n```\n\n**The `enterprise.splunk.com/delete-pvc` finalizer is optional, and tells the Splunk Operator to remove any Kubernetes [Persistent Volumes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/persistent-volumes/) associated with the instance if you delete the pod.**\n\nWithin a few minutes, you'll see new pods running in your namespace:\n\n```\n$ kubectl get pods\nNAME                                   READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE\nsplunk-operator-7c5599546c-wt4xl        1/1    Running   0          11h\nsplunk-s1-standalone-0                  1/1    Running   0          45s\n```\n\n*Note: if your shell prints a `%` at the end, leave that out when you copy the output.*\n\n2. You can use a simple network port forward to open port 8000 for Splunk Web access:\n\n```\nkubectl port-forward splunk-s1-standalone-0 8000\n```\n\n3. Get your passwords for the namespace. The Splunk Enterprise passwords used in the namespace are generated automatically. To learn how to find and read the passwords, see the [Reading global kubernetes secret object](Examples.md#reading-global-kubernetes-secret-object) page.\n\n\n4. Log into Splunk Enterprise at http://localhost:8000 using the `admin` account with the password.\n\n5. To delete your standalone deployment, run:\n\n```\nkubectl delete standalone s1\n``` \n\nThe `Standalone` custom resource is just one of the resources the Splunk Operator provides. You can find more custom resources and the parameters they support on the [Custom Resource Guide](CustomResources.md) page.\n\nFor additional deployment examples, including Splunk Enterprise clusters, see the \n[Configuring Splunk Enterprise Deployments](Examples.md) page.\n\nFor additional guidance on making Splunk Enterprise ports accessible outside of Kubernetes, see the [Configuring Ingress](Ingress.md) page.\n\n## Contacting Support\nIf you are a Splunk Enterprise customer with a valid support entitlement contract and have a Splunk-related question, you can open a support case on the https://www.splunk.com/ support portal.\"\n",

      "csv_description": "# Getting Started with the Splunk Operator for Kubernetes\nThe Splunk Operator for Kubernetes enables you to quickly and easily deploy Splunk Enterprise on your choice of private or public cloud provider. The Operator simplifies scaling and management of Splunk Enterprise by automating administrative workflows using Kubernetes best practices. \n\nThe Splunk Operator runs as a container, and uses the Kubernetes [operator pattern](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/operator/) and [custom resources](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/api-extension/custom-resources/) objects to create and manage a scalable and sustainable Splunk Enterprise environment.\n\nThis guide is intended to help new users get up and running with the\nSplunk Operator for Kubernetes. It is divided into the following sections:\n\n* [Known Issues for the Splunk Operator](#known-issues-for-the-splunk-operator)\n* [Prerequisites for the Splunk Operator](#prerequisites-for-the-splunk-operator)\n* [Installing the Splunk Operator](#installing-the-splunk-operator)\n* [Creating Splunk Enterprise Deployments](#creating-a-splunk-enterprise-deployment)\n* [Securing Splunk Deployments in Kubernetes](Security.md)\n* [Contacting Support](#contacting-support)\n\n## Support Resources\n\nSPLUNK SUPPORTED: The Splunk Operator for Kubernetes is a supported method for deploying distributed Splunk Enterprise environments using containers.\n\nCOMMUNITY DEVELOPED: Splunk Operator for Kubernetes is an open source product developed by Splunkers with contributions from the community of partners and customers. The primary reason why Splunk is taking this approach is to push product development closer to those that use and depend upon it. This direct connection will help us all be more successful and move at a rapid pace.\n\nIf you're interested in contributing to the SOK open source project, review the [Contributing to the Project](CONTRIBUTING.md) page.\n\n**Community Support & Discussions on\n[Slack](https://splunk-usergroups.slack.com)** channel #splunk-operator-for-kubernetes\n\n**File Issues or Enhancements in\n[GitHub](https://github.com/splunk/splunk-operator/issues)** splunk/splunk-operator\n\n\n## Known Issues for the Splunk Operator\n\nReview the [Change Log](ChangeLog.md) page for a history of changes in each release.\n\n## Prerequisites for the Splunk Operator\n\n### Supported Kubernetes Versions\n\n- Kubernetes, version 1.16.2+ and later (x86 64-bit only).\n\nThe Splunk Operator should work with any [CNCF certified distribution](https://www.cncf.io/certification/software-conformance/) of Kubernetes. We do not have platform recommendations, but this is a table of platforms that our developers, customers, and partners have used successfully with the Splunk Operator.\n\n<table>\n<tr><td> Splunk Development & Testing Platforms </td><td> Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS), Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) </td></tr>\n<tr><td> Customer Reported Platforms </td><td> Microsoft Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), Red Hat OpenShift </td></tr>\n<tr><td> Partner Tested Platforms</td><td> HPE Ezmeral</td></tr>\n<tr><td> Other Platforms </td><td>CNCF certified distribution</td></tr>\n</table>\n\n### Splunk Enterprise Compatibility\nEach Splunk Operator release has specific Splunk Enterprise compatibility requirements. Before installing or upgrading the Splunk Operator, review the [Change Log](ChangeLog.md) to verify version compatibility with Splunk Enterprise releases.\n\n### Splunk Apps Installation\n\nApps and add-ons can be installed using the Splunk Operator by following the instructions given at [Installing Splunk Apps](Examples.md#installing-splunk-apps).  Premium apps such as Enterprise Security and IT Service Intelligence are currently not supported.\n\n\n### Docker requirements\nThe Splunk Operator requires these docker images to be present or available to your Kubernetes cluster:\n\n* `splunk/splunk-operator`: The Splunk Operator image built by this repository or the [official release](https://hub.docker.com/r/splunk/splunk-operator) (2.0.0 or later)\n* `splunk/splunk:<version>`: The [Splunk Enterprise image](https://github.com/splunk/docker-splunk) (9.0.0 or later)\n\nAll of the Splunk Enterprise images are publicly available on [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/). If your cluster does not have access to pull from Docker Hub, see the [Required Images Documentation](Images.md) page.\n\nReview the [Change Log](ChangeLog.md) page for a history of changes and Splunk Enterprise compatibility for each release.\n\n### Hardware Resources Requirements\nThe resource guidelines for running production Splunk Enterprise instances in pods through the Splunk Operator are the same as running Splunk Enterprise natively on a supported operating system and file system. Refer to the Splunk Enterprise [Reference Hardware documentation](https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/latest/Capacity/Referencehardware) for additional details.  We would also recommend following the same guidance on [Splunk Enterprise for disabling Transparent Huge Pages (THP)](https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/latest/ReleaseNotes/SplunkandTHP) for the nodes in your Kubernetes cluster.  Please be aware that this may impact performance of other non-Splunk workloads.\n\n#### Minimum Reference Hardware\nBased on Splunk Enterprise [Reference Hardware documentation](https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/latest/Capacity/Referencehardware), a summary of the minimum reference hardware requirements is given below.\n\n| Standalone        | Search Head / Search Head Cluster | Indexer Cluster |\n| ---------- | ------- | ------- |\n| _Each Standalone Pod: 12 Physical CPU Cores or 24 vCPU at 2Ghz or greater per core, 12GB RAM._| _Each Search Head Pod: 16 Physical CPU Cores or 32 vCPU at 2Ghz or greater per core, 12GB RAM._| _Each Indexer Pod: 12 Physical CPU cores, or 24 vCPU at 2GHz or greater per core, 12GB RAM._ |\n\n\n#### _Using Kubernetes Quality of Service Classes_\n\nIn addition to the guidelines provided in the reference hardware, [Kubernetes Quality of Service Classes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/quality-service-pod/)  can be used to configure CPU/Mem resources allocations that map to your _service level objectives_. For further information on utilizing Kubernetes Quality of Service (QoS) classes, see the table below:\n\n\n| QoS        | Summary| Description |\n| ---------- | ------- | ------- |\n| _Guaranteed_ | _CPU/Mem ```requests``` = CPU/Mem ```limits```_    | _When the CPU and memory  ```requests``` and ```limits``` values are equal, the pod is given a QoS class of Guaranteed. This level of service is recommended for Splunk Enterprise ___production environments___._ |\n| _Burstable_ | _CPU/Mem ```requests``` < CPU/Mem ```limits```_  | _When the CPU and memory  ```requests``` value is set lower than the ```limits``` the pod is given a QoS class of Burstable. This level of service is useful in a user acceptance testing ___(UAT) environment___, where the pods run with minimum resources, and Kubernetes allocates additional resources depending on usage._|\n| _BestEffort_ | _No CPU/Mem ```requests``` or ```limits``` are set_ | _When the ```requests``` or ```limits``` values are not set, the pod is given a QoS class of BestEffort. This level of service is sufficient for ___testing, or a small development task___._ |\n\nExamples on how to implement these QoS are given at [Examples of Guaranteed and Burstable QoS](CustomResources.md#examples-of-guaranteed-and-burstable-qos) section.\n\n\n### Storage guidelines\nThe Splunk Operator uses Kubernetes [Persistent Volume Claims](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/persistent-volumes/#persistentvolumeclaims) to store all of your Splunk Enterprise configuration (\"$SPLUNK_HOME/etc\" path) and event (\"$SPLUNK_HOME/var\" path) data. If one of the underlying machines fail, Kubernetes will automatically try to recover by restarting the Splunk Enterprise pods on another machine that is able to reuse the same data volumes. This minimizes the maintenance burden on your operations team by reducing the impact of common hardware failures to the equivalent of a service restart. \nThe use of Persistent Volume Claims requires that your cluster is configured to support one or more Kubernetes persistent [Storage Classes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/storage-classes/). See the [Setting Up a Persistent Storage for Splunk](StorageClass.md) page for more\ninformation.\n\n### What Storage Type To Use?\n\nThe Kubernetes infrastructure must have access to storage that meets or exceeds the recommendations provided in the Splunk Enterprise storage type recommendations at [Reference Hardware documentation - what storage type to use for a given role?](https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/latest/Capacity/Referencehardware#What_storage_type_should_I_use_for_a_role.3F) In summary, Indexers with SmartStore need NVMe or SSD storage to provide the necessary IOPs for a successful Splunk Enterprise environment.\n\n\n### Splunk SmartStore Required\nFor production environments, we are requiring the use of Splunk SmartStore. As a Splunk Enterprise deployment's data volume increases, demand for storage typically outpaces demand for compute resources. [Splunk's SmartStore Feature](https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/latest/Indexer/AboutSmartStore) allows you to manage your indexer storage and compute resources in a ___cost-effective___ manner by scaling those resources separately. SmartStore utilizes a fast storage cache on each indexer node to keep recent data locally available for search and keep other data in a remote object store. Look into the [SmartStore Resource Guide](SmartStore.md) document for configuring and using SmartStore through operator.\n\n## Installing the Splunk Operator\n\nA Kubernetes cluster administrator can install and start the Splunk Operator for specific namespace by running:\n```\nkubectl apply -f https://github.com/splunk/splunk-operator/releases/download/2.0.0/splunk-operator-namespace.yaml\n```\n\nA Kubernetes cluster administrator can install and start the Splunk Operator for cluster-wide by running:\n```\nkubectl apply -f https://github.com/splunk/splunk-operator/releases/download/2.0.0/splunk-operator-cluster.yaml\n```\n\nThe [Advanced Installation Instructions](Install.md) page offers guidance for advanced configurations, including the use of private image registries, installation at cluster scope, and installing the Splunk Operator as a user who is not a Kubernetes administrator. Users of Red Hat OpenShift should review the [Red Hat OpenShift](OpenShift.md) page.\n\nThe [Advanced Installation Instructions](Install.md) page offers guidance for advanced configurations, including the use of private image registries, installation at cluster scope, and installing the Splunk Operator as a user who is not a Kubernetes administrator. Users of Red Hat OpenShift should review the [Red Hat OpenShift](OpenShift.md) page.\n\n*Note: We recommended that the Splunk Enterprise Docker image is copied to a private registry, or directly onto your Kubernetes workers before creating large Splunk Enterprise deployments. See the [Required Images Documentation](Images.md) page, and the [Advanced Installation Instructions](Install.md) page for guidance on working with copies of the Docker images.*\n\nAfter the Splunk Operator starts, you'll see a single pod running within your current namespace:\n```\n$ kubectl get pods\nNAME                               READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE\nsplunk-operator-75f5d4d85b-8pshn   1/1     Running   0          5s\n```\n## Upgrading the Splunk Operator\n\nFor information on upgrading the Splunk Operator, see the [How to upgrade Splunk Operator and Splunk Enterprise Deployments](SplunkOperatorUpgrade.md) page.\n\n## Creating a Splunk Enterprise deployment\n\nThe `Standalone` custom resource is used to create a single instance deployment of Splunk Enterprise. For example:\n\n1. Run the command to create a deployment named \u201cs1\u201d:\n\n\n```yaml\ncat <<EOF | kubectl apply -n splunk-operator -f -\napiVersion: enterprise.splunk.com/v3\nkind: Standalone\nmetadata:\n  name: s1\n  finalizers:\n  - enterprise.splunk.com/delete-pvc\nEOF\n```\n\n**The `enterprise.splunk.com/delete-pvc` finalizer is optional, and tells the Splunk Operator to remove any Kubernetes [Persistent Volumes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/persistent-volumes/) associated with the instance if you delete the pod.**\n\nWithin a few minutes, you'll see new pods running in your namespace:\n\n```\n$ kubectl get pods\nNAME                                   READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE\nsplunk-operator-7c5599546c-wt4xl        1/1    Running   0          11h\nsplunk-s1-standalone-0                  1/1    Running   0          45s\n```\n\n*Note: if your shell prints a `%` at the end, leave that out when you copy the output.*\n\n2. You can use a simple network port forward to open port 8000 for Splunk Web access:\n\n```\nkubectl port-forward splunk-s1-standalone-0 8000\n```\n\n3. Get your passwords for the namespace. The Splunk Enterprise passwords used in the namespace are generated automatically. To learn how to find and read the passwords, see the [Reading global kubernetes secret object](Examples.md#reading-global-kubernetes-secret-object) page.\n\n\n4. Log into Splunk Enterprise at http://localhost:8000 using the `admin` account with the password.\n\n5. To delete your standalone deployment, run:\n\n```\nkubectl delete standalone s1\n``` \n\nThe `Standalone` custom resource is just one of the resources the Splunk Operator provides. You can find more custom resources and the parameters they support on the [Custom Resource Guide](CustomResources.md) page.\n\nFor additional deployment examples, including Splunk Enterprise clusters, see the \n[Configuring Splunk Enterprise Deployments](Examples.md) page.\n\nFor additional guidance on making Splunk Enterprise ports accessible outside of Kubernetes, see the [Configuring Ingress](Ingress.md) page.\n\n## Contacting Support\nIf you are a Splunk Enterprise customer with a valid support entitlement contract and have a Splunk-related question, you can open a support case on the https://www.splunk.com/ support portal.\"\n",

      "csv_description": "# Getting Started with the Splunk Operator for Kubernetes\nThe Splunk Operator for Kubernetes enables you to quickly and easily deploy Splunk Enterprise on your choice of private or public cloud provider. The Operator simplifies scaling and management of Splunk Enterprise by automating administrative workflows using Kubernetes best practices. \n\nThe Splunk Operator runs as a container, and uses the Kubernetes [operator pattern](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/operator/) and [custom resources](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/api-extension/custom-resources/) objects to create and manage a scalable and sustainable Splunk Enterprise environment.\n\nThis guide is intended to help new users get up and running with the\nSplunk Operator for Kubernetes. It is divided into the following sections:\n\n* [Known Issues for the Splunk Operator](#known-issues-for-the-splunk-operator)\n* [Prerequisites for the Splunk Operator](#prerequisites-for-the-splunk-operator)\n* [Installing the Splunk Operator](#installing-the-splunk-operator)\n* [Creating Splunk Enterprise Deployments](#creating-a-splunk-enterprise-deployment)\n* [Securing Splunk Deployments in Kubernetes](Security.md)\n* [Contacting Support](#contacting-support)\n\n## Support Resources\n\nSPLUNK SUPPORTED: The Splunk Operator for Kubernetes is a supported method for deploying distributed Splunk Enterprise environments using containers.\n\nCOMMUNITY DEVELOPED: Splunk Operator for Kubernetes is an open source product developed by Splunkers with contributions from the community of partners and customers. The primary reason why Splunk is taking this approach is to push product development closer to those that use and depend upon it. This direct connection will help us all be more successful and move at a rapid pace.\n\nIf you're interested in contributing to the SOK open source project, review the [Contributing to the Project](CONTRIBUTING.md) page.\n\n**Community Support & Discussions on\n[Slack](https://splunk-usergroups.slack.com)** channel #splunk-operator-for-kubernetes\n\n**File Issues or Enhancements in\n[GitHub](https://github.com/splunk/splunk-operator/issues)** splunk/splunk-operator\n\n\n## Known Issues for the Splunk Operator\n\nReview the [Change Log](ChangeLog.md) page for a history of changes in each release.\n\n## Prerequisites for the Splunk Operator\n\n### Supported Kubernetes Versions\n\n- Kubernetes, version 1.16.2+ and later (x86 64-bit only).\n\nThe Splunk Operator should work with any [CNCF certified distribution](https://www.cncf.io/certification/software-conformance/) of Kubernetes. We do not have platform recommendations, but this is a table of platforms that our developers, customers, and partners have used successfully with the Splunk Operator.\n\n<table>\n<tr><td> Splunk Development & Testing Platforms </td><td> Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS), Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) </td></tr>\n<tr><td> Customer Reported Platforms </td><td> Microsoft Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), Red Hat OpenShift </td></tr>\n<tr><td> Partner Tested Platforms</td><td> HPE Ezmeral</td></tr>\n<tr><td> Other Platforms </td><td>CNCF certified distribution</td></tr>\n</table>\n\n### Splunk Enterprise Compatibility\nEach Splunk Operator release has specific Splunk Enterprise compatibility requirements. Before installing or upgrading the Splunk Operator, review the [Change Log](ChangeLog.md) to verify version compatibility with Splunk Enterprise releases.\n\n### Splunk Apps Installation\n\nApps and add-ons can be installed using the Splunk Operator by following the instructions given at [Installing Splunk Apps](Examples.md#installing-splunk-apps).  Premium apps such as Enterprise Security and IT Service Intelligence are currently not supported.\n\n\n### Docker requirements\nThe Splunk Operator requires these docker images to be present or available to your Kubernetes cluster:\n\n* `splunk/splunk-operator`: The Splunk Operator image built by this repository or the [official release](https://hub.docker.com/r/splunk/splunk-operator) (2.0.0 or later)\n* `splunk/splunk:<version>`: The [Splunk Enterprise image](https://github.com/splunk/docker-splunk) (9.0.0 or later)\n\nAll of the Splunk Enterprise images are publicly available on [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/). If your cluster does not have access to pull from Docker Hub, see the [Required Images Documentation](Images.md) page.\n\nReview the [Change Log](ChangeLog.md) page for a history of changes and Splunk Enterprise compatibility for each release.\n\n### Hardware Resources Requirements\nThe resource guidelines for running production Splunk Enterprise instances in pods through the Splunk Operator are the same as running Splunk Enterprise natively on a supported operating system and file system. Refer to the Splunk Enterprise [Reference Hardware documentation](https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/latest/Capacity/Referencehardware) for additional details.  We would also recommend following the same guidance on [Splunk Enterprise for disabling Transparent Huge Pages (THP)](https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/latest/ReleaseNotes/SplunkandTHP) for the nodes in your Kubernetes cluster.  Please be aware that this may impact performance of other non-Splunk workloads.\n\n#### Minimum Reference Hardware\nBased on Splunk Enterprise [Reference Hardware documentation](https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/latest/Capacity/Referencehardware), a summary of the minimum reference hardware requirements is given below.\n\n| Standalone        | Search Head / Search Head Cluster | Indexer Cluster |\n| ---------- | ------- | ------- |\n| _Each Standalone Pod: 12 Physical CPU Cores or 24 vCPU at 2Ghz or greater per core, 12GB RAM._| _Each Search Head Pod: 16 Physical CPU Cores or 32 vCPU at 2Ghz or greater per core, 12GB RAM._| _Each Indexer Pod: 12 Physical CPU cores, or 24 vCPU at 2GHz or greater per core, 12GB RAM._ |\n\n\n#### _Using Kubernetes Quality of Service Classes_\n\nIn addition to the guidelines provided in the reference hardware, [Kubernetes Quality of Service Classes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/quality-service-pod/)  can be used to configure CPU/Mem resources allocations that map to your _service level objectives_. For further information on utilizing Kubernetes Quality of Service (QoS) classes, see the table below:\n\n\n| QoS        | Summary| Description |\n| ---------- | ------- | ------- |\n| _Guaranteed_ | _CPU/Mem ```requests``` = CPU/Mem ```limits```_    | _When the CPU and memory  ```requests``` and ```limits``` values are equal, the pod is given a QoS class of Guaranteed. This level of service is recommended for Splunk Enterprise ___production environments___._ |\n| _Burstable_ | _CPU/Mem ```requests``` < CPU/Mem ```limits```_  | _When the CPU and memory  ```requests``` value is set lower than the ```limits``` the pod is given a QoS class of Burstable. This level of service is useful in a user acceptance testing ___(UAT) environment___, where the pods run with minimum resources, and Kubernetes allocates additional resources depending on usage._|\n| _BestEffort_ | _No CPU/Mem ```requests``` or ```limits``` are set_ | _When the ```requests``` or ```limits``` values are not set, the pod is given a QoS class of BestEffort. This level of service is sufficient for ___testing, or a small development task___._ |\n\nExamples on how to implement these QoS are given at [Examples of Guaranteed and Burstable QoS](CustomResources.md#examples-of-guaranteed-and-burstable-qos) section.\n\n\n### Storage guidelines\nThe Splunk Operator uses Kubernetes [Persistent Volume Claims](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/persistent-volumes/#persistentvolumeclaims) to store all of your Splunk Enterprise configuration (\"$SPLUNK_HOME/etc\" path) and event (\"$SPLUNK_HOME/var\" path) data. If one of the underlying machines fail, Kubernetes will automatically try to recover by restarting the Splunk Enterprise pods on another machine that is able to reuse the same data volumes. This minimizes the maintenance burden on your operations team by reducing the impact of common hardware failures to the equivalent of a service restart. \nThe use of Persistent Volume Claims requires that your cluster is configured to support one or more Kubernetes persistent [Storage Classes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/storage-classes/). See the [Setting Up a Persistent Storage for Splunk](StorageClass.md) page for more\ninformation.\n\n### What Storage Type To Use?\n\nThe Kubernetes infrastructure must have access to storage that meets or exceeds the recommendations provided in the Splunk Enterprise storage type recommendations at [Reference Hardware documentation - what storage type to use for a given role?](https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/latest/Capacity/Referencehardware#What_storage_type_should_I_use_for_a_role.3F) In summary, Indexers with SmartStore need NVMe or SSD storage to provide the necessary IOPs for a successful Splunk Enterprise environment.\n\n\n### Splunk SmartStore Required\nFor production environments, we are requiring the use of Splunk SmartStore. As a Splunk Enterprise deployment's data volume increases, demand for storage typically outpaces demand for compute resources. [Splunk's SmartStore Feature](https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/latest/Indexer/AboutSmartStore) allows you to manage your indexer storage and compute resources in a ___cost-effective___ manner by scaling those resources separately. SmartStore utilizes a fast storage cache on each indexer node to keep recent data locally available for search and keep other data in a remote object store. Look into the [SmartStore Resource Guide](SmartStore.md) document for configuring and using SmartStore through operator.\n\n## Installing the Splunk Operator\n\nA Kubernetes cluster administrator can install and start the Splunk Operator for specific namespace by running:\n```\nkubectl apply -f https://github.com/splunk/splunk-operator/releases/download/2.0.0/splunk-operator-namespace.yaml\n```\n\nA Kubernetes cluster administrator can install and start the Splunk Operator for cluster-wide by running:\n```\nkubectl apply -f https://github.com/splunk/splunk-operator/releases/download/2.0.0/splunk-operator-cluster.yaml\n```\n\nThe [Advanced Installation Instructions](Install.md) page offers guidance for advanced configurations, including the use of private image registries, installation at cluster scope, and installing the Splunk Operator as a user who is not a Kubernetes administrator. Users of Red Hat OpenShift should review the [Red Hat OpenShift](OpenShift.md) page.\n\nThe [Advanced Installation Instructions](Install.md) page offers guidance for advanced configurations, including the use of private image registries, installation at cluster scope, and installing the Splunk Operator as a user who is not a Kubernetes administrator. Users of Red Hat OpenShift should review the [Red Hat OpenShift](OpenShift.md) page.\n\n*Note: We recommended that the Splunk Enterprise Docker image is copied to a private registry, or directly onto your Kubernetes workers before creating large Splunk Enterprise deployments. See the [Required Images Documentation](Images.md) page, and the [Advanced Installation Instructions](Install.md) page for guidance on working with copies of the Docker images.*\n\nAfter the Splunk Operator starts, you'll see a single pod running within your current namespace:\n```\n$ kubectl get pods\nNAME                               READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE\nsplunk-operator-75f5d4d85b-8pshn   1/1     Running   0          5s\n```\n## Upgrading the Splunk Operator\n\nFor information on upgrading the Splunk Operator, see the [How to upgrade Splunk Operator and Splunk Enterprise Deployments](SplunkOperatorUpgrade.md) page.\n\n## Creating a Splunk Enterprise deployment\n\nThe `Standalone` custom resource is used to create a single instance deployment of Splunk Enterprise. For example:\n\n1. Run the command to create a deployment named \u201cs1\u201d:\n\n\n```yaml\ncat <<EOF | kubectl apply -n splunk-operator -f -\napiVersion: enterprise.splunk.com/v3\nkind: Standalone\nmetadata:\n  name: s1\n  finalizers:\n  - enterprise.splunk.com/delete-pvc\nEOF\n```\n\n**The `enterprise.splunk.com/delete-pvc` finalizer is optional, and tells the Splunk Operator to remove any Kubernetes [Persistent Volumes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/persistent-volumes/) associated with the instance if you delete the pod.**\n\nWithin a few minutes, you'll see new pods running in your namespace:\n\n```\n$ kubectl get pods\nNAME                                   READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE\nsplunk-operator-7c5599546c-wt4xl        1/1    Running   0          11h\nsplunk-s1-standalone-0                  1/1    Running   0          45s\n```\n\n*Note: if your shell prints a `%` at the end, leave that out when you copy the output.*\n\n2. You can use a simple network port forward to open port 8000 for Splunk Web access:\n\n```\nkubectl port-forward splunk-s1-standalone-0 8000\n```\n\n3. Get your passwords for the namespace. The Splunk Enterprise passwords used in the namespace are generated automatically. To learn how to find and read the passwords, see the [Reading global kubernetes secret object](Examples.md#reading-global-kubernetes-secret-object) page.\n\n\n4. Log into Splunk Enterprise at http://localhost:8000 using the `admin` account with the password.\n\n5. To delete your standalone deployment, run:\n\n```\nkubectl delete standalone s1\n``` \n\nThe `Standalone` custom resource is just one of the resources the Splunk Operator provides. You can find more custom resources and the parameters they support on the [Custom Resource Guide](CustomResources.md) page.\n\nFor additional deployment examples, including Splunk Enterprise clusters, see the \n[Configuring Splunk Enterprise Deployments](Examples.md) page.\n\nFor additional guidance on making Splunk Enterprise ports accessible outside of Kubernetes, see the [Configuring Ingress](Ingress.md) page.\n\n## Contacting Support\nIf you are a Splunk Enterprise customer with a valid support entitlement contract and have a Splunk-related question, you can open a support case on the https://www.splunk.com/ support portal.\"\n",

The operator automatically installs the required host networking software - bringing together all the needed components to provide high-speed network connectivity. These components include the NVIDIA networking driver, Kubernetes device plugin, CNI plugins, IP address management (IPAM) plugin and others.\nThe NVIDIA Network Operator works in conjunction with the NVIDIA GPU Operator to deliver high-throughput, low-latency networking for scale-out, GPU computing clusters.\n\nThe Network Operator uses Node Feature Discovery (NFD) labels in order to properly schedule resources.\nNodes can be labelled manually or using the NFD Operator. An example of `NodeFeatureDiscovery`\nconfiguration is available in the documentation.\nThe following NFD labels are used:\n`feature.node.kubernetes.io/pci-15b3.present` for nodes containing NVIDIA Networking hardware.\n`feature.node.kubernetes.io/pci-10de.present` for nodes containing NVIDIA GPU hardware.\n\nThe Network Operator is open-source. For more information on contributions and release artifacts, see the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/Mellanox/network-operator/)\n",

This operator is installed in all namespaces which can support multi-tenant scenarios. **Note:** This operator should only be used by Red Hat partners attempting to certify their operator(s).\n\n\n**Requirements**\n\n\nThe certification operator requires that you have the following tools installed, functional, and in your path.\n- [Install](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.8/cli_reference/openshift_cli/getting-started-cli.html#installing-openshift-cli) oc, the OpenShift CLI tool (tested with version 4.7.13)\n- [Install](https://tekton.dev/docs/cli/) tkn, the Tekton CLI tool (tested with version 0.19.1)\n- [Install](https://git-scm.com/downloads) git, the Git CLI tool (tested with 2.32.0)\n- The certification pipeline expects you to have the source files of your Operator bundle\n\n\n**Pre - Installation**\n\n\nThe below steps exist for simplicity and to make the installation clearer. The operator watches all namespaces, so if secrets/configs/etc already exist in another namespace, feel free to use the existing namespace when following the operator installation steps.\n\n\n**Create a new namespace where the following secrets will be applied.**\n```\noc new-project oco\n```\n\n\n**Add the kubeconfig secret which will be used to deploy the operator under test and run the certification checks.**\n* Open a terminal window\n* Set the `KUBECONFIG` environment variable\n```\nexport KUBECONFIG=/path/to/your/cluster/kubeconfig\n```\n> *This kubeconfig will be used to deploy the Operator under test and run the certification checks.*\n```\noc create secret generic kubeconfig --from-file=kubeconfig=$KUBECONFIG\n```\n\n\n**Configuring steps for submitting the results**\n- Add the github API token to the repo where the PR will be created\n```\noc create secret generic github-api-token --from-literal GITHUB_TOKEN=<github token>\n```\n- Add RedHat Container API access key\n\n  This API access key is specifically related to your unique partner account for Red Hat Connect portal.

      "csv_description": "The Couchbase Autonomous Operator allows users to easily deploy, manage, and maintain Couchbase deployments on OpenShift. By installing this integration you will be able to deply Couchbase Server clusters with a single command.\n\n## Supported Features\n\n* **Automated cluster provisioning** - Deploying a Couchbase Cluster has never been easier. Fill out a Couchbase specific configuration and let the Couchbase Operator take care of provisioning nodes and setting up cluster to your exact specification.\n\n* **On-demand scalability** - Automatically scale your cluster up or down by changing a simple configuration parameter and let the Couchbase Operator handle provisioning of new nodes and joining them into the cluster.\n\n* **Auto-recovery** - Detect Couchbase node failures, rebalance out bad nodes, and bring the cluster back up to the desired capacity. Auto-recovery is completely automated so you can sleep easy through the night knowing that the Couchbase Operator will handle any failures.\n\n* **Geo-distribution** - Replicate your data between datacenters to move data closer to the users who consume it and protect against disaster scenarios where an entire datacenter becomes unavailable.\n\n* **Persistent storage** - Define persistent network-attached storage for each node in your cluster to allow pods to be recovered even if the node they were running on is no longer available.\n\n* **Rack/zone awareness** - Tell the Couchbase Operator about availability zones in your datacenter and let the operator take care of ensuring that nodes in your cluster are deployed equally across each zone.\n\n* **Supportability** - When things go wrong, use the cbopinfo tool provided with the Couchbase Operator to collect relevant data about your Couchbase deployment so that you can quickly address issues.\n\n* **Centralized configuration management** - Manage your configuration centrally with OpenShift. Updates to the configuration are watched by the Couchbase Operator and actions are taken to make the target cluster match the desired configuration.\n## Required Parameters\n* `authSecret` - provide the name of a secret that contains two keys for the `username` and `password` of the super user ([documentation](https://docs.couchbase.com/operator/1.2/couchbase-cluster-config.html))\n\n## About Couchbase Server\n\nBuilt on the most powerful NoSQL technology, Couchbase Server delivers unparalleled performance at scale, in any cloud. With features like memory-first architecture, geo-distributed deployments, and workload isolation, Couchbase Server excels at supporting mission-critical applications at scale while maintaining submillisecond latencies and 99.999% availability. Plus, with the most comprehensive SQL-compatible query language (N1QL), migrating from RDBMS to Couchbase Server is easy with ANSI joins.\n",

      "csv_description": "The Couchbase Autonomous Operator allows users to easily deploy, manage, and maintain Couchbase deployments on OpenShift. By installing this integration you will be able to deply Couchbase Server clusters with a single command.\n\n## Supported Features\n\n* **Automated cluster provisioning** - Deploying a Couchbase Cluster has never been easier. Fill out a Couchbase specific configuration and let the Couchbase Operator take care of provisioning nodes and setting up cluster to your exact specification.\n\n* **On-demand scalability** - Automatically scale your cluster up or down by changing a simple configuration parameter and let the Couchbase Operator handle provisioning of new nodes and joining them into the cluster.\n\n* **Auto-recovery** - Detect Couchbase node failures, rebalance out bad nodes, and bring the cluster back up to the desired capacity. Auto-recovery is completely automated so you can sleep easy through the night knowing that the Couchbase Operator will handle any failures.\n\n* **Geo-distribution** - Replicate your data between datacenters to move data closer to the users who consume it and protect against disaster scenarios where an entire datacenter becomes unavailable.\n\n* **Persistent storage** - Define persistent network-attached storage for each node in your cluster to allow pods to be recovered even if the node they were running on is no longer available.\n\n* **Rack/zone awareness** - Tell the Couchbase Operator about availability zones in your datacenter and let the operator take care of ensuring that nodes in your cluster are deployed equally across each zone.\n\n* **Supportability** - When things go wrong, use the cbopinfo tool provided with the Couchbase Operator to collect relevant data about your Couchbase deployment so that you can quickly address issues.\n\n* **Centralized configuration management** - Manage your configuration centrally with OpenShift. Updates to the configuration are watched by the Couchbase Operator and actions are taken to make the target cluster match the desired configuration.\n## Required Parameters\n* `authSecret` - provide the name of a secret that contains two keys for the `username` and `password` of the super user ([documentation](https://docs.couchbase.com/operator/1.2/couchbase-cluster-config.html))\n\n## About Couchbase Server\n\nBuilt on the most powerful NoSQL technology, Couchbase Server delivers unparalleled performance at scale, in any cloud. With features like memory-first architecture, geo-distributed deployments, and workload isolation, Couchbase Server excels at supporting mission-critical applications at scale while maintaining submillisecond latencies and 99.999% availability. Plus, with the most comprehensive SQL-compatible query language (N1QL), migrating from RDBMS to Couchbase Server is easy with ANSI joins.\n",

      "csv_description": "The Couchbase Autonomous Operator allows users to easily deploy, manage, and maintain Couchbase deployments on OpenShift. By installing this integration you will be able to deply Couchbase Server clusters with a single command.\n\n## Supported Features\n\n* **Automated cluster provisioning** - Deploying a Couchbase Cluster has never been easier. Fill out a Couchbase specific configuration and let the Couchbase Operator take care of provisioning nodes and setting up cluster to your exact specification.\n\n* **On-demand scalability** - Automatically scale your cluster up or down by changing a simple configuration parameter and let the Couchbase Operator handle provisioning of new nodes and joining them into the cluster.\n\n* **Auto-recovery** - Detect Couchbase node failures, rebalance out bad nodes, and bring the cluster back up to the desired capacity. Auto-recovery is completely automated so you can sleep easy through the night knowing that the Couchbase Operator will handle any failures.\n\n* **Geo-distribution** - Replicate your data between datacenters to move data closer to the users who consume it and protect against disaster scenarios where an entire datacenter becomes unavailable.\n\n* **Persistent storage** - Define persistent network-attached storage for each node in your cluster to allow pods to be recovered even if the node they were running on is no longer available.\n\n* **Rack/zone awareness** - Tell the Couchbase Operator about availability zones in your datacenter and let the operator take care of ensuring that nodes in your cluster are deployed equally across each zone.\n\n* **Supportability** - When things go wrong, use the cbopinfo tool provided with the Couchbase Operator to collect relevant data about your Couchbase deployment so that you can quickly address issues.\n\n* **Centralized configuration management** - Manage your configuration centrally with OpenShift. Updates to the configuration are watched by the Couchbase Operator and actions are taken to make the target cluster match the desired configuration.\n## Required Parameters\n* `authSecret` - provide the name of a secret that contains two keys for the `username` and `password` of the super user ([documentation](https://docs.couchbase.com/operator/1.2/couchbase-cluster-config.html))\n\n## About Couchbase Server\n\nBuilt on the most powerful NoSQL technology, Couchbase Server delivers unparalleled performance at scale, in any cloud. With features like memory-first architecture, geo-distributed deployments, and workload isolation, Couchbase Server excels at supporting mission-critical applications at scale while maintaining submillisecond latencies and 99.999% availability. Plus, with the most comprehensive SQL-compatible query language (N1QL), migrating from RDBMS to Couchbase Server is easy with ANSI joins.\n",

      "csv_description": "The Couchbase Autonomous Operator allows users to easily deploy, manage, and maintain Couchbase deployments on OpenShift. By installing this integration you will be able to deply Couchbase Server clusters with a single command.\n\n## Supported Features\n\n* **Automated cluster provisioning** - Deploying a Couchbase Cluster has never been easier. Fill out a Couchbase specific configuration and let the Couchbase Operator take care of provisioning nodes and setting up cluster to your exact specification.\n\n* **On-demand scalability** - Automatically scale your cluster up or down by changing a simple configuration parameter and let the Couchbase Operator handle provisioning of new nodes and joining them into the cluster.\n\n* **Auto-recovery** - Detect Couchbase node failures, rebalance out bad nodes, and bring the cluster back up to the desired capacity. Auto-recovery is completely automated so you can sleep easy through the night knowing that the Couchbase Operator will handle any failures.\n\n* **Geo-distribution** - Replicate your data between datacenters to move data closer to the users who consume it and protect against disaster scenarios where an entire datacenter becomes unavailable.\n\n* **Persistent storage** - Define persistent network-attached storage for each node in your cluster to allow pods to be recovered even if the node they were running on is no longer available.\n\n* **Rack/zone awareness** - Tell the Couchbase Operator about availability zones in your datacenter and let the operator take care of ensuring that nodes in your cluster are deployed equally across each zone.\n\n* **Supportability** - When things go wrong, use the cbopinfo tool provided with the Couchbase Operator to collect relevant data about your Couchbase deployment so that you can quickly address issues.\n\n* **Centralized configuration management** - Manage your configuration centrally with OpenShift. Updates to the configuration are watched by the Couchbase Operator and actions are taken to make the target cluster match the desired configuration.\n## Required Parameters\n* `authSecret` - provide the name of a secret that contains two keys for the `username` and `password` of the super user ([documentation](https://docs.couchbase.com/operator/1.2/couchbase-cluster-config.html))\n\n## About Couchbase Server\n\nBuilt on the most powerful NoSQL technology, Couchbase Server delivers unparalleled performance at scale, in any cloud. With features like memory-first architecture, geo-distributed deployments, and workload isolation, Couchbase Server excels at supporting mission-critical applications at scale while maintaining submillisecond latencies and 99.999% availability. Plus, with the most comprehensive SQL-compatible query language (N1QL), migrating from RDBMS to Couchbase Server is easy with ANSI joins.\n",
