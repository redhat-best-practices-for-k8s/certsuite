The operator will not deploy a DB but will require you to specify the configuration values to connect to it.\n\nSearch for JFrog and click JFrog Artifactory Enterprise Operator to install.\n\nGo to the Installed Operators.\n\nWait for the JFrog Artifactory Enterprise Operator to complete the installation.\n\nOpen the Operator and click on the provided API: Artifactory HA.\n\nClick Create New Instance and provide the following parameters for your DB configuration:\n\n```\nDATABASE_TYPE\nDATABASE_DRIVER\nDATABASE_URL\nDATABASE_USER\nDATABASE_PASSWORD\n```\nMaster key and Join key must be supplied. To generate a new key for each run the command below:\n\n```\n# Create a key\nexport JOIN_KEY=$(openssl rand -hex 32)\necho ${JOIN_KEY}\n```\n\nTo use TLS you will need to first create a k8s tls secret to store your .crt and .key file into.\nThen supply the value of this k8s secret into the TLS_SECRET field.\n``` oc create secret tls my_tls_secret --cert=tls.crt --key=tls.key --namespace=my_namespace ```\nClick Create for Artifactory Enterprise to deploy into OpenShift and connect to it on the external IP exposed by the load balancer.\n### Create a route\nTo expose Artifactory from Openshift we recommend you create a new route in Openshift.\nYou can either use the oc command line tool or the Openshift web console to generate a new route.\nDepending upon where you terminate TLS you will need to either specify pass through or edge.\nCommand Line (Edge):\n``` oc create route edge --service=openshiftartifactory-ha --cert=tls.crt --key=tls.key --ca-cert=ca.crt --hostname=www.example.com ```\nOr for more information visit the official Openshift documentation on routes here:\nhttps://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.6/networking/routes/route-configuration.html\n\n",

      "csv_description": "# Overview\nThe Avanseus CAN operator deploys and manages the CAN (Cognitive assistant for networks)  predictive maintainence tool on any Kubernetes based cloud environment.\n\nAvanseus Cognitive Assistant for Networks (CAN), applies AI and machine learning to predict where a network is likely to fail next, and what to do before it happens.  CAN operator bundles CAN, CAS, LDAP, VBI, Prediction controller & Prediction worker applications.\n\nSupporting links:\n- [CAN operator prerequisite & configuration](https://avanseuscandev.com/releases/CAN/5.5/redhat/CAN_redhat_openshift_operator_installation.pdf): This is similar to the content mentioned from next section\n- [Password encryption](https://avanseuscandev.com/releases/CAN/5.5/redhat/CAN_password_encryption.pdf):  Utility guide for encrypting password texts\n- [CAN user manual](https://avanseuscandev.com/releases/CAN/5.5/Release/CAN_5.5_User_Manual.pdf)\n- [CAN operator installation video](https://avanseuscandev.com/releases/CAN/5.5/Videos/can-operator-openshift-installation-guide.mp4)\n\n# Operator installation\nMentioned below are the pre-requisites & configuration steps to be followed to install the CAN operator.\n### Before you start\n\n - A MongoDB instance must be available to connect to from the pods. This is usually provided by the \nenterprise customer. If not, then this has to be installed separately.\n - An initial MongoDB data dump needs to be loaded in the database. Please contact [Avanseus \ndelivery](mailto:support@avanseus.com).\n - In case, LDAP is not provided by the customer, [Avanseus delivery](mailto:support@avanseus.com) team can be requested to\n provide a LDAP image which is essential for Web dashboard authentication.\n - Binary files of applications does not come as part of the operator. These need to be requested from [Avanseus delivery](mailto:support@avanseus.com) team.\n - Create a project, service account & configure that service account using the below commands\n   \n   ```sh\n   \n   oc new-project <PROJECT_OR_NAMESPACE>\n   \n   oc create sa avanseus\n   \n   oc adm policy add-scc-to-user anyuid system:serviceaccount:<PROJECT_OR_NAMESPACE>:avanseus\n   \n   ```\n   \n   Replace `<PROJECT_OR_NAMESPACE>` with relevant namespace where the configurations provided in the `Configuration prerequisites` section below will be done & also where the operator would be installed.\n   \n   \n\nAvanseus delivery team can be contacted  at <support@avanseus.com>.\nMentioned below are the prerequisite configurations required for installing CAN operator. \n## Third party software pre-requisites\nTable shown below, specifies the supported versions of the third party software or protocol.\n<table><tr><th>Compatible software/protocol</th><th>Supported version</th></tr><tr><td>MongoDB</td><td>v4.4.5</td></tr><tr><td>LDAP protocol</td><td>Version-3</td></tr><tr><td>Memcached</td><td>1.5</td></tr></table>\n\n### Third party software availability\n- ***MongoDB with initial data***\n\n  For the CAN application to come up successfully, it needs some initial data in MongoDB.\n  However if it is not available, then [Avanseus delivery](mailto:support@avanseus.com) team needs \n  to be contacted for an initial data dump that needs to be imported to a MongoDB schema. MongoDB \n  can either be within the Openshift platform or outside. This MongoDB schema must be accessible from the \n  CAN operator pods preferably on port 27017. \n  \n- ***LDAP with initial user data***\n\n  For the CAN application, authentication is made possible using LDAP. Usually customers provide an LDAP connection for integration. However, if LDAP is not made available by the customer, then a LDAP\npod comes as part of operator installation by default with one initial user. [Avanseus delivery](mailto:support@avanseus.com) team needs to be requested to get the user access details. \n  If customer provides LDAP, then it can be other Openshift or within the cluster. The LDAP Host and port details must be configured in a ConfigMap.\n  \n- ***Memcached***\n\n  Memcached is used by CAN to cache small data for fast retrieval. This is also used for tomcat session replication. This application comes by default with the operator.\n\n\n## Configuration prerequisites\n\n### PersistenceVolumeClaim to copy WAR files\nBy default, the CAN operator does not come with CAN binary. [Avanseus delivery](mailto:support@avanseus.com) team must be requested to obtain the WAR files. Before deploying, the binaries in need to be obtained and put into a PersistentVolume. Mentioned below is a method to do this.\n\nThese binaries are:\n\n\n - CAN.war\n - CAS.war\n - PredictionController.war\n - universal\n\n\nCreate a PersistenceVolumeClaim \"tmp-data\". Mentioned below is an example configuration YAML\n```sh\nkind: PersistentVolumeClaim\napiVersion: v1\nmetadata:\n name: tmp-data\nspec:\n accessModes:\n - ReadWriteOnce\n resources:\n  requests:\n   storage: 1G\n\n```\nCreate a dummy application (Apache server) and mount the created PersistenceVolumeClaim. Mentioned below is the YAML content\n```sh\napiVersion: v1\nkind: Pod\nmetadata:\n name: pod-httpd\n labels:\n  app: apache_webserver\nspec:\n containers:\n - name: cntr-httpd\n   image: httpd:latest\n   ports:\n   - containerPort: 80\n   volumeMounts:\n   - mountPath: /mnt\n     name: tmp-data\n volumes:\n - name: tmp-data\n   persistentVolumeClaim:\n    claimName: tmp-data\n\n```\nChange directory to the place where WAR files are available. Copy the WAR files provided by Avanseus into the mount point \"/mnt\" using the rsync command.\n```sh\noc rsync . pod-httpd:/mnt\n```\nOnce this is done, the dummy application pod can be stopped. Remember that \"tmp-data\" PersistentVolume must not be deleted as this is used by Operator components to pull the binaries.\n### PersistenceVolumeClaim for CAN application\nCreate a PersistenceVolumeClaim named \"candatapvc\" & \"canlogpvc\". This is needed for the CAN application to write files.  YAML configuration is given below.\n```sh\nkind: PersistentVolumeClaim\napiVersion: v1\nmetadata:\n name: candatapvc\nspec:\n accessModes:\n - ReadWriteOnce\nresources:\n requests:\n  storage: 5G\n\n---\n\nkind: PersistentVolumeClaim\napiVersion: v1\nmetadata:\n name: canlogpvc\nspec:\n accessModes:\n - ReadWriteOnce\nresources:\n requests:\n  storage: 5G\n\n```\n### PesistentVolumeClaim for LDAP application\nCreate a PersistentVolumeClaim named \"ldap-storage\". This is needed for LDAP module to store the user DB data in a persistent location. YAML configuration is given is given below.\n```sh\nkind: PersistentVolumeClaim\napiVersion: v1\nmetadata:\n name: ldap-storage\nspec:\n accessModes:\n - ReadWriteOnce\nresources:\n requests:\n  storage: 5G\n\n```\n\n### Config Maps\nPods within the operator need configurations to startup the application. These configurations have to be stored in Config maps on Openshift platform.\nCAN operator comes with 5 applications which would run in 5 different pods:\n - CAN (Needs config map)\n - LDAP\n - VBI\n - Prediction controller (Needs config map)\n - Prediction worker\n\n### CAN config map (``canconfig``)\n\nMentioned below are the ConfigMap entries CAN application needs & hence create 3 files mentioned below:\n#### ``catalina.properties`` - Catalina file for tomcat:\n```sh\n# Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one or more\n# contributor license agreements.

Please skip these versions.\n\n## Overview\nOpenshift Operator to deploy JFrog Artifactory Enterprise into your Openshift cluster.\n## Security Context Constraints\nTo deploy this helm chart you will need to be a cluster admin w/ access to the anyuid scc and add the operator service account to the anyuid scc.\n```\noc adm policy add-scc-to-user anyuid -z artifactory-ha-operator -n openshift-operators\n```\nAdd the service account for the Artifactory chart to deploy successfully:\n``` oc adm policy add-scc-to-user anyuid -z openshiftartifactoryha-artifactory-ha -n artifactory ```\n### Usage\n\nAn external DB is required. The operator will not deploy a DB but will require you to specify the configuration values to connect to it.\n\nSearch for JFrog and click JFrog Artifactory Enterprise Operator to install.\n\nGo to the Installed Operators.\n\nWait for the JFrog Artifactory Enterprise Operator to complete the installation.\n\nOpen the Operator and click on the provided API: Artifactory HA.\n\nClick Create New Instance and provide the following parameters for your DB configuration:\n\n```\nDATABASE_TYPE\nDATABASE_DRIVER\nDATABASE_URL\nDATABASE_USER\nDATABASE_PASSWORD\n```\nMaster key and Join key must be supplied. To generate a new key for each run the command below:\n\n```\n# Create a key\nexport JOIN_KEY=$(openssl rand -hex 32)\necho ${JOIN_KEY}\n```\n\nTo use TLS you will need to first create a k8s tls secret to store your .crt and .key file into.\nThen supply the value of this k8s secret into the TLS_SECRET field.\n``` oc create secret tls my_tls_secret --cert=tls.crt --key=tls.key --namespace=my_namespace ```\nClick Create for Artifactory Enterprise to deploy into OpenShift and connect to it on the external IP exposed by the load balancer.\n### Create a route\nTo expose Artifactory from Openshift we recommend you create a new route in Openshift.\nYou can either use the oc command line tool or the Openshift web console to generate a new route.\nDepending upon where you terminate TLS you will need to either specify pass through or edge.\nCommand Line (Edge):\n``` oc create route edge --service=openshiftartifactory-ha --cert=tls.crt --key=tls.key --ca-cert=ca.crt --hostname=www.example.com ```\nOr for more information visit the official Openshift documentation on routes here:\nhttps://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.6/networking/routes/route-configuration.html\n\n",

You can even create regularly scheduled\n  backups as well and set your backup retention policy\n- **Disaster Recovery**: Backups and restores leverage the open source [pgBackRest][] utility\n  and [includes support for full, incremental, and differential backups as well as efficient delta restores][disaster-recovery].\n  Set how long you want your backups retained for. Works great with very large databases!\n- **Monitoring**: Track the health of your PostgreSQL clusters using the open source [pgMonitor][] library.\n- **Clone**: Create new clusters from your existing clusters or backups with a single [`pgo create cluster --restore-from`][pgo-create-cluster] command.\n- **TLS**: Secure communication between your applications and data servers by [enabling TLS for your PostgreSQL servers][pgo-task-tls], including the ability to enforce that all of your connections to use TLS.\n- **Connection Pooling**: Use [pgBouncer][] for connection pooling\n- **Affinity and Tolerations**: Have your PostgreSQL clusters deployed to [Kubernetes Nodes][k8s-nodes] of your preference with [node affinity][high-availability-node-affinity], or designate which nodes Kubernetes can schedule PostgreSQL instances to with Kubernetes [tolerations][high-availability-tolerations].\n- **Full Customizability**: Crunchy PostgreSQL for OpenShift makes it easy to get your own PostgreSQL-as-a-Service up and running on\n  and lets make further enhancements to customize your deployments, including:\n    - Selecting different storage classes for your primary, replica, and backup storage\n    - Select your own container resources class for each PostgreSQL cluster deployment; differentiate between resources applied for primary and replica clusters!\n    - Use your own container image repository, including support `imagePullSecrets` and private repositories\n    - Bring your own trusted certificate authority (CA) for use with the Operator API server\n    - Override your PostgreSQL configuration for each cluster\n\nand much more!\n\n[disaster-recovery]: https://access.crunchydata.com/documentation/postgres-operator/latest/architecture/disaster-recovery/\n[high-availability]: https://access.crunchydata.com/documentation/postgres-operator/latest/architecture/high-availability/\n[high-availability-node-affinity]: https://access.crunchydata.com/documentation/postgres-operator/latest/architecture/high-availability/#node-affinity\n[high-availability-tolerations]: https://access.crunchydata.com/documentation/postgres-operator/latest/architecture/high-availability/#tolerations\n[pgo-create-cluster]: https://access.crunchydata.com/documentation/postgres-operator/latest/pgo-client/reference/pgo_create_cluster/\n[pgo-task-tls]: https://access.crunchydata.com/documentation/postgres-operator/latest/tutorial/tls/\n[provisioning]: https://access.crunchydata.com/documentation/postgres-operator/latest/architecture/provisioning/\n\n[k8s-anti-affinity]: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/assign-pod-node/#inter-pod-affinity-and-anti-affinity\n[k8s-nodes]: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/architecture/nodes/\n\n[pgBackRest]: https://www.pgbackrest.org\n[pgBouncer]: https://access.crunchydata.com/documentation/postgres-operator/latest/tutorial/pgbouncer/\n[pgMonitor]: https://github.com/CrunchyData/pgmonitor\n\n## Pre-Installation\n\nThere are a few manual steps that the cluster administrator must perform prior to installing the PostgreSQL Operator.\nAt the very least, it must be provided with an initial configuration.\n\nFirst, select a namespace in which to install the PostgreSQL Operator. PostgreSQL clusters will also be deployed here.\nIf it does not exist, create it now.\n\n```\nexport PGO_OPERATOR_NAMESPACE=pgo\noc create namespace \"$PGO_OPERATOR_NAMESPACE\"\n```\n\n### Security\n\nFor the PostgreSQL Operator and PostgreSQL clusters to run in the recommended `restricted` [Security Context Constraint][],\nedit `conf/postgres-operator/pgo.yaml` and set `DisableFSGroup` to `true`.\n\n[Security Context Constraint]: https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/latest/authentication/managing-security-context-constraints.html\n\n### Secrets (optional)\n\nIf you plan to use AWS S3 to store backups, you can configure your environment to automatically provide your AWS S3 credentials to all newly created PostgreSQL clusters:\n\n```\noc -n \"$PGO_OPERATOR_NAMESPACE\" create secret generic pgo-backrest-repo-config \\\n  --from-literal=aws-s3-key=\"<your-aws-s3-key>\" \\\n  --from-literal=aws-s3-key-secret=\"<your-aws-s3-key-secret>\"\noc -n \"$PGO_OPERATOR_NAMESPACE\" label secret pgo-backrest-repo-config vendor=crunchydata\n```\n\n### Certificates (optional)\n\nThe PostgreSQL Operator has an API that uses TLS to communicate securely with clients.

There are several\nthat a PostgreSQL cluster requires to be deployed, including:\n\n- Secrets\n  - Information for setting up a pgBackRest repository\n  - PostgreSQL superuser bootstrap credentials\n  - PostgreSQL replication user bootstrap credentials\n  - PostgresQL standard user bootstrap credentials\n\nAdditionally, if you want to add some of the other sidecars, you may need to\ncreate additional secrets.\n\nThe good news is that if you do not provide these objects, the PostgreSQL\nOperator will create them for you to get your Postgres cluster up and running!\n\nThe following goes through how to create a PostgreSQL cluster called\n`hippo` by creating a new custom resource.\n\n```\n# this variable is the name of the cluster being created\nexport pgo_cluster_name=hippo\n# this variable is the namespace the cluster is being deployed into\nexport cluster_namespace=pgo\n# this variable is set to the location of your image repository\nexport cluster_image_prefix=registry.developers.crunchydata.com/crunchydata\n\ncat <<-EOF > \"${pgo_cluster_name}-pgcluster.yaml\"\napiVersion: crunchydata.com/v1\nkind: Pgcluster\nmetadata:\n  annotations:\n    current-primary: ${pgo_cluster_name}\n  labels:\n    crunchy-pgha-scope: ${pgo_cluster_name}\n    deployment-name: ${pgo_cluster_name}\n    name: ${pgo_cluster_name}\n    pg-cluster: ${pgo_cluster_name}\n    pgo-version: 4.7.3\n    pgouser: admin\n  name: ${pgo_cluster_name}\n  namespace: ${cluster_namespace}\nspec:\n  BackrestStorage:\n    accessmode: ReadWriteMany\n    matchLabels: \"\"\n    name: \"\"\n    size: 1G\n    storageclass: \"\"\n    storagetype: create\n    supplementalgroups: \"\"\n  PrimaryStorage:\n    accessmode: ReadWriteMany\n    matchLabels: \"\"\n    name: ${pgo_cluster_name}\n    size: 1G\n    storageclass: \"\"\n    storagetype: create\n    supplementalgroups: \"\"\n  ReplicaStorage:\n    accessmode: ReadWriteMany\n    matchLabels: \"\"\n    name: \"\"\n    size: 1G\n    storageclass: \"\"\n    storagetype: create\n    supplementalgroups: \"\"\n  annotations: {}\n  ccpimage: crunchy-postgres-ha\n  ccpimageprefix: ${cluster_image_prefix}\n  ccpimagetag: centos8-13.4-4.7.3\n  clustername: ${pgo_cluster_name}\n  database: ${pgo_cluster_name}\n  exporterport: \"9187\"\n  limits: {}\n  name: ${pgo_cluster_name}\n  pgDataSource:\n    restoreFrom: \"\"\n    restoreOpts: \"\"\n  pgbadgerport: \"10000\"\n  pgoimageprefix: ${cluster_image_prefix}\n  podAntiAffinity:\n    default: preferred\n    pgBackRest: preferred\n    pgBouncer: preferred\n  port: \"5432\"\n  tolerations: []\n  user: hippo\n  userlabels:\n    pgo-version: 4.7.3\nEOF\n\noc apply -f \"${pgo_cluster_name}-pgcluster.yaml\"\n```\n\nAnd that's all! The PostgreSQL Operator will go ahead and create the cluster.\n\nIf you have the PostgreSQL client `psql` installed on your host machine, you can\ntest connection to the PostgreSQL cluster using the following command:\n\n```\n# namespace that the cluster is running in\nexport PGO_OPERATOR_NAMESPACE=pgo\n# name of the cluster\nexport pgo_cluster_name=hippo\n# name of the user whose password we want to get\nexport pgo_cluster_username=hippo\n\n# get the password of the user and set it to a recognized psql environmental variable\nexport PGPASSWORD=$(oc -n \"${PGO_OPERATOR_NAMESPACE}\" get secrets \\\n  \"${pgo_cluster_name}-${pgo_cluster_username}-secret\" -o \"jsonpath={.data['password']}\" | base64 -d)\n\n# set up a port-forward either in a new terminal, or in the same terminal in the background:\noc -n pgo port-forward svc/hippo 5432:5432 &\n\npsql -h localhost -U \"${pgo_cluster_username}\" \"${pgo_cluster_name}\"\n```\n\n### Create a PostgreSQL Cluster the `pgo` Client\n\nOnce the PostgreSQL Operator is installed in your OpenShift cluster, you will need to do a few things\nto use the [PostgreSQL Operator Client][pgo-client].\n\n[pgo-client]: https://access.crunchydata.com/documentation/postgres-operator/latest/pgo-client/\n\nInstall the first set of client credentials and download the `pgo` binary and client certificates.\n\n```\ncurl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CrunchyData/postgres-operator/v4.7.3/deploy/install-bootstrap-creds.sh > install-bootstrap-creds.sh\ncurl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CrunchyData/postgres-operator/v4.7.3/installers/kubectl/client-setup.sh > client-setup.sh\n\nchmod +x install-bootstrap-creds.sh client-setup.sh\n\nPGO_CMD=oc ./install-bootstrap-creds.sh\nPGO_CMD=oc ./client-setup.sh\n```\n\nThe client needs to be able to reach the PostgreSQL Operator API from outside the OpenShift cluster.\nCreate an external service or forward a port locally.\n\n```\noc -n \"$PGO_OPERATOR_NAMESPACE\" expose deployment postgres-operator\noc -n \"$PGO_OPERATOR_NAMESPACE\" create route passthrough postgres-operator --service=postgres-operator\n\nexport PGO_APISERVER_URL=\"https://$(oc -n \"$PGO_OPERATOR_NAMESPACE\" get route postgres-operator -o jsonpath=\"{.spec.host}\")\"\n```\n_or_\n```\noc -n \"$PGO_OPERATOR_NAMESPACE\" port-forward deployment/postgres-operator 8443\n\nexport PGO_APISERVER_URL=\"https://127.0.0.1:8443\"\n```\n\nVerify connectivity using the `pgo` command.\n\n```\npgo version\n# pgo client version 4.7.3\n# pgo-apiserver version 4.7.3\n```\n\n\nYou can then create a cluster with the `pgo` client as simply as this:\n\n```\npgo create cluster -n pgo hippo\n```\n\nThe cluster may take a few moments to provision. You can verify that the cluster is up and running by using the `pgo test` command:\n\n```\npgo test cluster -n pgo hippo\n```\n\nIf you have the PostgreSQL client `psql` installed on your host machine, you can\ntest connection to the PostgreSQL cluster using the following command:\n\n```\n# namespace that the cluster is running in\nexport PGO_OPERATOR_NAMESPACE=pgo\n# name of the cluster\nexport pgo_cluster_name=hippo\n# name of the user whose password we want to get\nexport pgo_cluster_username=hippo\n\n# get the password of the user and set it to a recognized psql environmental variable\nexport PGPASSWORD=$(kubectl -n \"${PGO_OPERATOR_NAMESPACE}\" get secrets \\\n  \"${pgo_cluster_name}-${pgo_cluster_username}-secret\" -o \"jsonpath={.data['password']}\" | base64 -d)\n\n# set up a port-forward either in a new terminal, or in the same terminal in the background:\nkubectl -n pgo port-forward svc/hippo 5432:5432 &\n\npsql -h localhost -U \"${pgo_cluster_username}\" \"${pgo_cluster_name}\"\n```",

      "csv_description": "Apache CouchDB lets you access your data where you need it. The [Couch Replication Protocol](http://docs.couchdb.org/en/master/replication/protocol.html) is implemented in a variety of projects and products that span every imaginable computing environment from globally distributed server-clusters, over mobile phones to web browsers.\n\nStore your data safely, on your own servers, or with any leading cloud provider. Your web- and native applications love CouchDB, because it speaks JSON natively and supports binary data for all your data storage needs.\n\nThe [Couch Replication Protocol](http://docs.couchdb.org/en/master/replication/protocol.html) lets your data flow seamlessly between server clusters to mobile phones and web browsers, enabling a compelling [offline-first](http://offlinefirst.org/) user-experience while maintaining high performance and strong reliability. CouchDB comes with a developer-friendly query language, and optionally MapReduce for simple, efficient, and comprehensive data retrieval.\n\n### Operator for Apache CouchDB Features\n* Fully automated deployment and configuration of Apache CouchDB clusters.\n* Support single, multiple, or all namespace install modes.\n\n#### Security\n* TLS - TLS  is supported using Red Hat Service certificates or user-provided certificates.\n* Authentication - The parameter `require_valid_user` defaults to `true`, which means that no requests are allowed from anonymous users. Every request must be authenticated.\n* Authorization - Databases are initially accessible by Apache CouchDB admins only.\n\n#### High Availability\n* Nodes - Each database node in an Apache CouchDB cluster requires its own Kubernetes node. It's recommended that you run it with a minimum of three nodes for any production deployment.\n* Zones - The Apache CouchDB cluster database nodes are spread across available Kubernetes fault zones where available.\n* Replicas - The default configuration for each database is two shards (Q=2) and three shard copies (N=3), where each shard copy is deployed on a separate node in the cluster.\n\n### Reading and writing to Apache CouchDB\n\nThe Operator for Apache CouchDB automatically generates a Service. This can be accessed using port-forwarding e.g. `kubectl port-forward svc/my-couchdb-cluster 443:443 -u admin:mypassword`. Alternatively, configure an OpenShift Route to expose the service externally.\n\n### CouchDB 2.3.1 Update Instructions\nWhen the operator is updated to v2.0 or above any existing CouchDB 2.3.1 cluster will not be automatically upgraded to CouchDB 3. The user must manually trigger this process by removing the version statement `version: 2.3.1` in the CouchDBCluster CR for each CouchDB cluster\nThe operator will then perform a rolling update, with the new pods running CouchDB3.\nIt is advised that customers do this straightaway as CouchDB 2.3.1 is no longer supported.\n\n[Read the complete guide to using the Operator for Apache CouchDB](https://ibm.biz/BdfGQy)\n",

      "csv_description": "Apache CouchDB lets you access your data where you need it. The [Couch Replication Protocol](http://docs.couchdb.org/en/master/replication/protocol.html) is implemented in a variety of projects and products that span every imaginable computing environment from globally distributed server-clusters, over mobile phones to web browsers.\n\nStore your data safely, on your own servers, or with any leading cloud provider. Your web- and native applications love CouchDB, because it speaks JSON natively and supports binary data for all your data storage needs.\n\nThe [Couch Replication Protocol](http://docs.couchdb.org/en/master/replication/protocol.html) lets your data flow seamlessly between server clusters to mobile phones and web browsers, enabling a compelling [offline-first](http://offlinefirst.org/) user-experience while maintaining high performance and strong reliability. CouchDB comes with a developer-friendly query language, and optionally MapReduce for simple, efficient, and comprehensive data retrieval.\n\n### Operator for Apache CouchDB Features\n* Fully automated deployment and configuration of Apache CouchDB clusters.\n* Support single, multiple, or all namespace install modes.\n\n#### Security\n* TLS - TLS  is supported using Red Hat Service certificates or user-provided certificates.\n* Authentication - The parameter `require_valid_user` defaults to `true`, which means that no requests are allowed from anonymous users. Every request must be authenticated.\n* Authorization - Databases are initially accessible by Apache CouchDB admins only.\n\n#### High Availability\n* Nodes - Each database node in an Apache CouchDB cluster requires its own Kubernetes node. It's recommended that you run it with a minimum of three nodes for any production deployment.\n* Zones - The Apache CouchDB cluster database nodes are spread across available Kubernetes fault zones where available.\n* Replicas - The default configuration for each database is two shards (Q=2) and three shard copies (N=3), where each shard copy is deployed on a separate node in the cluster.\n\n### Reading and writing to Apache CouchDB\n\nThe Operator for Apache CouchDB automatically generates a Service. This can be accessed using port-forwarding e.g. `kubectl port-forward svc/my-couchdb-cluster 443:443 -u admin:mypassword`. Alternatively, configure an OpenShift Route to expose the service externally.\n\n### CouchDB 2.3.1 Update Instructions\nWhen the operator is updated to v2.0 or above any existing CouchDB 2.3.1 cluster will not be automatically upgraded to CouchDB 3. The user must manually trigger this process by removing the version statement `version: 2.3.1` in the CouchDBCluster CR for each CouchDB cluster\nThe operator will then perform a rolling update, with the new pods running CouchDB3.\nIt is advised that customers do this straightaway as CouchDB 2.3.1 is no longer supported.\n\n[Read the complete guide to using the Operator for Apache CouchDB](https://ibm.biz/BdfGQy)\n",

      "csv_description": "Apache CouchDB lets you access your data where you need it. The [Couch Replication Protocol](http://docs.couchdb.org/en/master/replication/protocol.html) is implemented in a variety of projects and products that span every imaginable computing environment from globally distributed server-clusters, over mobile phones to web browsers.\n\nStore your data safely, on your own servers, or with any leading cloud provider. Your web- and native applications love CouchDB, because it speaks JSON natively and supports binary data for all your data storage needs.\n\nThe [Couch Replication Protocol](http://docs.couchdb.org/en/master/replication/protocol.html) lets your data flow seamlessly between server clusters to mobile phones and web browsers, enabling a compelling [offline-first](http://offlinefirst.org/) user-experience while maintaining high performance and strong reliability. CouchDB comes with a developer-friendly query language, and optionally MapReduce for simple, efficient, and comprehensive data retrieval.\n\n### Operator for Apache CouchDB Features\n* Fully automated deployment and configuration of Apache CouchDB clusters.\n* Support single, multiple, or all namespace install modes.\n\n#### Security\n* TLS - TLS  is supported using Red Hat Service certificates or user-provided certificates.\n* Authentication - The parameter `require_valid_user` defaults to `true`, which means that no requests are allowed from anonymous users. Every request must be authenticated.\n* Authorization - Databases are initially accessible by Apache CouchDB admins only.\n\n#### High Availability\n* Nodes - Each database node in an Apache CouchDB cluster requires its own Kubernetes node. It's recommended that you run it with a minimum of three nodes for any production deployment.\n* Zones - The Apache CouchDB cluster database nodes are spread across available Kubernetes fault zones where available.\n* Replicas - The default configuration for each database is two shards (Q=2) and three shard copies (N=3), where each shard copy is deployed on a separate node in the cluster.\n\n### Reading and writing to Apache CouchDB\n\nThe Operator for Apache CouchDB automatically generates a Service. This can be accessed using port-forwarding e.g. `kubectl port-forward svc/my-couchdb-cluster 443:443 -u admin:mypassword`. Alternatively, configure an OpenShift Route to expose the service externally.\n\n### CouchDB 2.3.1 Update Instructions\nWhen the operator is updated to v2.0 or above any existing CouchDB 2.3.1 cluster will not be automatically upgraded to CouchDB 3. The user must manually trigger this process by removing the version statement `version: 2.3.1` in the CouchDBCluster CR for each CouchDB cluster\nThe operator will then perform a rolling update, with the new pods running CouchDB3.\nIt is advised that customers do this straightaway as CouchDB 2.3.1 is no longer supported.\n\n[Read the complete guide to using the Operator for Apache CouchDB](https://ibm.biz/BdfGQy)\n",

      "csv_description": "Apache CouchDB lets you access your data where you need it. The [Couch Replication Protocol](http://docs.couchdb.org/en/master/replication/protocol.html) is implemented in a variety of projects and products that span every imaginable computing environment from globally distributed server-clusters, over mobile phones to web browsers.\n\nStore your data safely, on your own servers, or with any leading cloud provider. Your web- and native applications love CouchDB, because it speaks JSON natively and supports binary data for all your data storage needs.\n\nThe [Couch Replication Protocol](http://docs.couchdb.org/en/master/replication/protocol.html) lets your data flow seamlessly between server clusters to mobile phones and web browsers, enabling a compelling [offline-first](http://offlinefirst.org/) user-experience while maintaining high performance and strong reliability. CouchDB comes with a developer-friendly query language, and optionally MapReduce for simple, efficient, and comprehensive data retrieval.\n\n### Operator for Apache CouchDB Features\n* Fully automated deployment and configuration of Apache CouchDB clusters.\n* Support single, multiple, or all namespace install modes.\n\n#### Security\n* TLS - TLS  is supported using Red Hat Service certificates or user-provided certificates.\n* Authentication - The parameter `require_valid_user` defaults to `true`, which means that no requests are allowed from anonymous users. Every request must be authenticated.\n* Authorization - Databases are initially accessible by Apache CouchDB admins only.\n\n#### High Availability\n* Nodes - Each database node in an Apache CouchDB cluster requires its own Kubernetes node. It's recommended that you run it with a minimum of three nodes for any production deployment.\n* Zones - The Apache CouchDB cluster database nodes are spread across available Kubernetes fault zones where available.\n* Replicas - The default configuration for each database is two shards (Q=2) and three shard copies (N=3), where each shard copy is deployed on a separate node in the cluster.\n\n### Reading and writing to Apache CouchDB\n\nThe Operator for Apache CouchDB automatically generates a Service. This can be accessed using port-forwarding e.g. `kubectl port-forward svc/my-couchdb-cluster 443:443 -u admin:mypassword`. Alternatively, configure an OpenShift Route to expose the service externally.\n\n### CouchDB 2.3.1 Update Instructions\nWhen the operator is updated to v2.0 or above any existing CouchDB 2.3.1 cluster will not be automatically upgraded to CouchDB 3. The user must manually trigger this process by removing the version statement `version: 2.3.1` in the CouchDBCluster CR for each CouchDB cluster\nThe operator will then perform a rolling update, with the new pods running CouchDB3.\nIt is advised that customers do this straightaway as CouchDB 2.3.1 is no longer supported.\n\n[Read the complete guide to using the Operator for Apache CouchDB](https://ibm.biz/BdfGQy)\n",

      "csv_description": "Apache CouchDB lets you access your data where you need it. The [Couch Replication Protocol](http://docs.couchdb.org/en/master/replication/protocol.html) is implemented in a variety of projects and products that span every imaginable computing environment from globally distributed server-clusters, over mobile phones to web browsers.\n\nStore your data safely, on your own servers, or with any leading cloud provider. Your web- and native applications love CouchDB, because it speaks JSON natively and supports binary data for all your data storage needs.\n\nThe [Couch Replication Protocol](http://docs.couchdb.org/en/master/replication/protocol.html) lets your data flow seamlessly between server clusters to mobile phones and web browsers, enabling a compelling [offline-first](http://offlinefirst.org/) user-experience while maintaining high performance and strong reliability. CouchDB comes with a developer-friendly query language, and optionally MapReduce for simple, efficient, and comprehensive data retrieval.\n\n### Operator for Apache CouchDB Features\n* Fully automated deployment and configuration of Apache CouchDB clusters.\n* Support single, multiple, or all namespace install modes.\n\n#### Security\n* TLS - TLS  is supported using Red Hat Service certificates or user-provided certificates.\n* Authentication - The parameter `require_valid_user` defaults to `true`, which means that no requests are allowed from anonymous users. Every request must be authenticated.\n* Authorization - Databases are initially accessible by Apache CouchDB admins only.\n\n#### High Availability\n* Nodes - Each database node in an Apache CouchDB cluster requires its own Kubernetes node. It's recommended that you run it with a minimum of three nodes for any production deployment.\n* Zones - The Apache CouchDB cluster database nodes are spread across available Kubernetes fault zones where available.\n* Replicas - The default configuration for each database is two shards (Q=2) and three shard copies (N=3), where each shard copy is deployed on a separate node in the cluster.\n\n### Reading and writing to Apache CouchDB\n\nThe Operator for Apache CouchDB automatically generates a Service. This can be accessed using port-forwarding e.g. `kubectl port-forward svc/my-couchdb-cluster 443:443 -u admin:mypassword`. Alternatively, configure an OpenShift Route to expose the service externally.\n\n### CouchDB 2.3.1 Update Instructions\nWhen the operator is updated to v2.0 or above any existing CouchDB 2.3.1 cluster will not be automatically upgraded to CouchDB 3. The user must manually trigger this process by removing the version statement `version: 2.3.1` in the CouchDBCluster CR for each CouchDB cluster\nThe operator will then perform a rolling update, with the new pods running CouchDB3.\nIt is advised that customers do this straightaway as CouchDB 2.3.1 is no longer supported.\n\n[Read the complete guide to using the Operator for Apache CouchDB](https://ibm.biz/BdfGQy)\n",

      "csv_description": "Apache CouchDB lets you access your data where you need it. The [Couch Replication Protocol](http://docs.couchdb.org/en/master/replication/protocol.html) is implemented in a variety of projects and products that span every imaginable computing environment from globally distributed server-clusters, over mobile phones to web browsers.\n\nStore your data safely, on your own servers, or with any leading cloud provider. Your web- and native applications love CouchDB, because it speaks JSON natively and supports binary data for all your data storage needs.\n\nThe [Couch Replication Protocol](http://docs.couchdb.org/en/master/replication/protocol.html) lets your data flow seamlessly between server clusters to mobile phones and web browsers, enabling a compelling [offline-first](http://offlinefirst.org/) user-experience while maintaining high performance and strong reliability. CouchDB comes with a developer-friendly query language, and optionally MapReduce for simple, efficient, and comprehensive data retrieval.\n\n### Operator for Apache CouchDB Features\n* Fully automated deployment and configuration of Apache CouchDB clusters.\n* Support single, multiple, or all namespace install modes.\n\n#### Security\n* TLS - TLS  is supported using Red Hat Service certificates or user-provided certificates.\n* Authentication - The parameter `require_valid_user` defaults to `true`, which means that no requests are allowed from anonymous users. Every request must be authenticated.\n* Authorization - Databases are initially accessible by Apache CouchDB admins only.\n\n#### High Availability\n* Nodes - Each database node in an Apache CouchDB cluster requires its own Kubernetes node. It's recommended that you run it with a minimum of three nodes for any production deployment.\n* Zones - The Apache CouchDB cluster database nodes are spread across available Kubernetes fault zones where available.\n* Replicas - The default configuration for each database is two shards (Q=2) and three shard copies (N=3), where each shard copy is deployed on a separate node in the cluster.\n\n### Reading and writing to Apache CouchDB\n\nThe Operator for Apache CouchDB automatically generates a Service. This can be accessed using port-forwarding e.g. `kubectl port-forward svc/my-couchdb-cluster 443:443 -u admin:mypassword`. Alternatively, configure an OpenShift Route to expose the service externally.\n\n### CouchDB 2.3.1 Update Instructions\nWhen the operator is updated to v2.0 or above any existing CouchDB 2.3.1 cluster will not be automatically upgraded to CouchDB 3. The user must manually trigger this process by removing the version statement `version: 2.3.1` in the CouchDBCluster CR for each CouchDB cluster\nThe operator will then perform a rolling update, with the new pods running CouchDB3.\nIt is advised that customers do this straightaway as CouchDB 2.3.1 is no longer supported.\n\n[Read the complete guide to using the Operator for Apache CouchDB](https://ibm.biz/BdfGQy)\n",

      "csv_description": "Federator.ai helps enterprises optimize cloud resources, maximize application performance, and save significant cost without excessive over-provisioning or under-provisioning of resources, meeting the service-level requirements of their applications.\n\nEnterprises often lack understanding of the resources needed to support their applications. This leads to either excessive over-provisioning or under-provisioning of resources (CPU, memory, storage). Using machine learning, Federator.ai determines the optimal cloud resources needed to support any workload on OpenShift and helps users find the best-cost instances from cloud providers for their applications.\n\n\n**Multi-layer workload prediction**\n\nUsing machine learning and math-based algorithms, Federator.ai predicts containerized application and cluster node resource usage as the basis for resource recommendations at application level as well as at cluster node level. Federator.ai supports prediction for both physical/virtual CPUs and memories.\n\n\n**Auto-scaling via resource recommendation**\n\nFederator.ai utilizes the predicted resource usage to recommend the right number and size of pods for applications. Integrated with Datadog's WPA, applications are automatically scaled to meet the predicted resource usage.\n\n\n**Application-aware recommendation execution**\n\nOptimizing the resource usage and performance goals, Federator.ai uses application specific metrics for workload prediction and pod capacity estimation to auto-scale the right number of pods for best performance without overprovisioning.\n\n\n**Multi-cloud Cost Analysis**\n\nWith resource usage prediction, Federator.ai analyzes potential cost of a cluster on different public cloud providers. It also recommend appropriate cluster nodes and instance types based on resource usage.\n\n\n**Custom Datadog/Sysdig Dashboards**\n\nPredefined custom Datadog/Sysdig Dashboards for workload prediction/recommendation visualization for cluster nodes and applications.\n\n\n**Additional resources**\n\nWant more product information?

      "csv_description": "# Overview\nThe Avanseus CAN operator deploys and manages the CAN (Cognitive assistant for networks)  predictive maintainence tool on any Kubernetes based cloud environment.\n\nAvanseus Cognitive Assistant for Networks (CAN), applies AI and machine learning to predict where a network is likely to fail next, and what to do before it happens.  CAN operator bundles CAN, CAS, LDAP, VBI, Prediction controller & Prediction worker applications.\n\nSupporting links:\n- [CAN operator prerequisite & configuration](https://avanseuscandev.com/releases/CAN/5.5/redhat/CAN_redhat_openshift_operator_installation.pdf): This is similar to the content mentioned from next section\n- [Password encryption](https://avanseuscandev.com/releases/CAN/5.5/redhat/CAN_password_encryption.pdf):  Utility guide for encrypting password texts\n- [CAN user manual](https://avanseuscandev.com/releases/CAN/5.5/Release/CAN_5.5_User_Manual.pdf)\n- [CAN operator installation video](https://avanseuscandev.com/releases/CAN/5.5/Videos/can-operator-openshift-installation-guide.mp4)\n\n# Operator installation\nMentioned below are the pre-requisites & configuration steps to be followed to install the CAN operator.\n### Before you start\n\n - A MongoDB instance must be available to connect to from the pods. This is usually provided by the \nenterprise customer. If not, then this has to be installed separately.\n - An initial MongoDB data dump needs to be loaded in the database. Please contact [Avanseus \ndelivery](mailto:support@avanseus.com).\n - In case, LDAP is not provided by the customer, [Avanseus delivery](mailto:support@avanseus.com) team can be requested to\n provide a LDAP image which is essential for Web dashboard authentication.\n - Binary files of applications does not come as part of the operator. These need to be requested from [Avanseus delivery](mailto:support@avanseus.com) team.\n - Create a project, service account & configure that service account using the below commands\n   \n   ```sh\n   \n   oc new-project <PROJECT_OR_NAMESPACE>\n   \n   oc create sa avanseus\n   \n   oc adm policy add-scc-to-user anyuid system:serviceaccount:<PROJECT_OR_NAMESPACE>:avanseus\n   \n   ```\n   \n   Replace `<PROJECT_OR_NAMESPACE>` with relevant namespace where the configurations provided in the `Configuration prerequisites` section below will be done & also where the operator would be installed.\n   \n   \n\nAvanseus delivery team can be contacted  at <support@avanseus.com>.\nMentioned below are the prerequisite configurations required for installing CAN operator. \n## Third party software pre-requisites\nTable shown below, specifies the supported versions of the third party software or protocol.\n<table><tr><th>Compatible software/protocol</th><th>Supported version</th></tr><tr><td>MongoDB</td><td>v4.4.5</td></tr><tr><td>LDAP protocol</td><td>Version-3</td></tr><tr><td>Memcached</td><td>1.5</td></tr></table>\n\n### Third party software availability\n- ***MongoDB with initial data***\n\n  For the CAN application to come up successfully, it needs some initial data in MongoDB.\n  However if it is not available, then [Avanseus delivery](mailto:support@avanseus.com) team needs \n  to be contacted for an initial data dump that needs to be imported to a MongoDB schema. MongoDB \n  can either be within the Openshift platform or outside. This MongoDB schema must be accessible from the \n  CAN operator pods preferably on port 27017. \n  \n- ***LDAP with initial user data***\n\n  For the CAN application, authentication is made possible using LDAP. Usually customers provide an LDAP connection for integration. However, if LDAP is not made available by the customer, then a LDAP\npod comes as part of operator installation by default with one initial user. [Avanseus delivery](mailto:support@avanseus.com) team needs to be requested to get the user access details. \n  If customer provides LDAP, then it can be outside Openshift or within the cluster. The LDAP Host and port details must be configured in a ConfigMap.\n  \n- ***Memcached***\n\n  Memcached is used by CAN to cache small data for fast retrieval. This is also used for tomcat session replication. This application comes by default with the operator.\n\n\n## Configuration prerequisites\n\n### PersistentVolumeClaim to copy WAR files\nBy default, the CAN operator does not come with CAN binary. [Avanseus delivery](mailto:support@avanseus.com) team must be requested to obtain the WAR files. Before deploying, the binaries in need to be obtained and put into a PersistentVolume. Mentioned below is a method to do this.\n\nThese binaries are:\n\n\n - CAN.war\n - CAS.war\n - PredictionController.war\n - universal\n\n\nCreate a PersistentVolumeClaim \"tmp-data\". Mentioned below is an example configuration YAML\n```sh\nkind: PersistentVolumeClaim\napiVersion: v1\nmetadata:\n name: tmp-data\nspec:\n accessModes:\n - ReadWriteOnce\n resources:\n  requests:\n   storage: 1G\n\n```\nCreate a dummy application (Apache server) and mount the created PersistentVolumeClaim. Mentioned below is the YAML content\n```sh\napiVersion: v1\nkind: Pod\nmetadata:\n name: pod-httpd\n labels:\n  app: apache_webserver\nspec:\n containers:\n - name: cntr-httpd\n   image: httpd:latest\n   ports:\n   - containerPort: 80\n   volumeMounts:\n   - mountPath: /mnt\n     name: tmp-data\n volumes:\n - name: tmp-data\n   persistentVolumeClaim:\n    claimName: tmp-data\n\n```\nChange directory to the place where WAR files are available. Copy the WAR files provided by Avanseus into the mount point \"/mnt\" using the rsync command.\n```sh\noc rsync . pod-httpd:/mnt\n```\nOnce this is done, the dummy application pod can be stopped. Remember that \"tmp-data\" PersistentVolume must not be deleted as this is used by Operator components to pull the binaries.\n### PersistentVolumeClaim for CAN application\nCreate a PersistentVolumeClaim named \"candatapvc\" & \"canlogpvc\". This is needed for the CAN application to write files.  YAML configuration is given below.\n```sh\nkind: PersistentVolumeClaim\napiVersion: v1\nmetadata:\n name: candatapvc\nspec:\n accessModes:\n - ReadWriteOnce\nresources:\n requests:\n  storage: 5G\n\n---\n\nkind: PersistentVolumeClaim\napiVersion: v1\nmetadata:\n name: canlogpvc\nspec:\n accessModes:\n - ReadWriteOnce\nresources:\n requests:\n  storage: 5G\n\n```\n### PesistentVolumeClaim for LDAP application\nCreate a PersistentVolumeClaim named \"ldap-storage\". This is needed for LDAP module to store the user DB data in a persistent location. YAML configuration is given below.\n```sh\nkind: PersistentVolumeClaim\napiVersion: v1\nmetadata:\n name: ldap-storage\nspec:\n accessModes:\n - ReadWriteOnce\nresources:\n requests:\n  storage: 5G\n\n```\n\n### Config Maps\nPods within the operator need configurations to startup the application. These configurations have to be stored in Config maps on Openshift platform.\nCAN operator comes with 5 applications which would run in 5 different pods:\n - CAN (Needs config map)\n - LDAP\n - VBI\n - Prediction controller (Needs config map)\n - Prediction worker\n\n### CAN config map (``canconfig``)\n\nMentioned below are the ConfigMap entries CAN application needs & hence create 3 files mentioned below:\n#### ``catalina.properties`` - Catalina file for tomcat:\n```sh\n# Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one or more\n# contributor license agreements.

Mentioned below are their details:\n\n - `<AVANSEUS_PASSWORD_KEY>` : Replace this with the password key to be used. Request the [Avanseus delivery](mailto:support@avanseus.com) team for this. This is very specific for a given DB dump.\n - `<NAMESPACE>` : Namespace where the operator and application would run.\n - `<ROUTER_DEFAULT_HOSTNAME>` : Replace this with the Openshift cluster default router hostname.\n - `<MONGODB_SSL_ENABLED>` : `true` when MongoDB is enabled with SSL. `false` otherwise.\n - `<MONGODB_VERIFY_HOST>` : `true` when MongoDB host name needs to be verified with SSL certificate. `false` otherwise.\n - `<MONGODB_KEYSTORE_PASSWORD>` : Encrypted password of MongoDB keystore. The encryption technique is defined [here](https://avanseuscandev.com/releases/CAN/5.0/redhat/CAN_password_encryption.pdf)\n - `<MONGODB_IP>` : Replace this with MongoDB IP/Host which is reachable from the pods. \n - `<MONGODB_PORT>` : Replace this with MongoDB Port which is reachable from the pods.\n - `<MONGODB_USERNAME>` : Replace this with MongoDB schema read/write username.\n - `<MONGODB_PASSWORD>` : Replace this with above username's password (Encrypted). The encryption technique is defined [here](https://avanseuscandev.com/releases/CAN/5.0/redhat/CAN_password_encryption.pdf)\n - `<MONGODB_SCHEMA_NAME>` : Replace this with DB schema name.\n - `<MONGODB_ADMIN_USERNAME>` : Replace this with MongoDB admin username\n - `<MONGODB_ADMIN_PASSWORD>` : Replace this with MongoDB admin password (Encrypted). The encryption technique is defined [here](https://avanseuscandev.com/releases/CAN/5.0/redhat/CAN_password_encryption.pdf)\n - `<MONGODB_ADMIN_SCHEMA_NAME>` : Replace this with the MongoDB admin schema name.\n - `<GOOGLE_MAP_KEY>` : Google map key.\n - `<LDAP_URL1>` : Replace this with LDAP URL 1. LDAP IP reachable from pods.\n - `<LDAP_URL2>` : Replace this with LDAP URL 2. Same as above if the customer does not provide failover LDAP URL.\n - `<LDAP_PORT1>` : Replace this with LDAP Port 1. LDAP port reachable from pods.\n - `<LDAP_PORT2>` : Replace this with LDAP Port 2. Same as above if the customer does not provide failover LDAP instance.\n - `<LDAP_PASSWORD>` : Replace this with LDAP password (Encrypted). The encryption technique is defined [here](https://avanseuscandev.com/releases/CAN/5.0/redhat/CAN_password_encryption.pdf)\n - `<LDAP_ORG>` : Replace this with LDAP organisation. Customers usually provide this or contact Avanseus support team for this.\n - `<LDAP_DOMAIN>` : Replace this with LDAP domain. Customers usually provide this or contact Avanseus support team for this.\n - `<EMAIL_FROM_ID>` : Replace this with Email ID of sender.\n - `<EMAIL_SENDER_NAME>` : Replace this with Email sender's name.\n - `<EMAIL_SERVER>` : Replace this with Email server host or domain.\n - `<EMAIL_PORT>` : Replace this with Email server port.\n - `<EMAIL_PASSWORD>` : Replace this with Email sender's password.\n\nThe last 5 entries must be filled up with relevant SMTP server or relay server information which is reachable from the Openshift cluster.\n\nIf you would use the Default LDAP server coming with the operator, then the LDAP configuration section can be as follows:\n```sh\n#LDAP server configuration\navanseus.ldap.organisation=employee\navanseus.ldap.domain=avanseus\navanseus.ldap.url1=ldap://ldap:1389\navanseus.ldap.url2=ldap://ldap:1389\navanseus.ldap.userDn=cn=Directory Manager\navanseus.ldap.password=r7qs0Kobh5s+q0Wtlj1JZbtkdqGxBdx/\n\n```\nFinally create the ConfigMap as follows:\n\n```sh\noc create configmap canconfig --from-file=catalina.properties --from-file=config.properties --from-file=mongo.pkcs12\n```\n### Prediction controller config map (``controllerconfig``)\nMentioned below is the ConfigMap entry Prediction controller application needs & hence create the file mentioned below:\n#### ``application.properties`` - Application configuration\n```sh\nserver.port=5052\nlogging.level.root = INFO\nspring.application.name=PredictionControllerApplication\npredictionworker.endpoint=http://avanseusworkernode:5050/PredictionWorker/\n#predictionworker.endpoint=http://localhost:5050/\n# Max file size.\nspring.servlet.multipart.max-file-size=40MB\n# Max request size.\nspring.servlet.multipart.max-request-size=50MB\n\n```\nFinally create the ConfigMap as follows:\n```sh\noc create configmap controllerconfig --from-file=application.properties\n```\n\n\n## Installation\nCAN Operator is available in the OperatorHub section. Mentioned below is a link to the video which shows how to install the CAN operator.\n\n[CAN operator installation video](https://avanseuscandev.com/releases/CAN/5.5/Videos/can-operator-openshift-installation-guide.mp4)\n\n## Post installation\nAfter installation, CAN application would be available on following URL:\n```sh\nhttps://can-<NAMESPACE>.<ROUTER_DEFAULT_HOSTNAME>/CAN/\n```\nIf CAN tool was integrated with LDAP on customer premise, then the user credentials would be known. If CAN tool was integrated with Avanseus's default LDAP, then request the [Avanseus delivery](mailto:support@avanseus.com) team for credentials.\n",

      "csv_description": "# Overview\nThe Avanseus CAN operator deploys and manages the CAN (Cognitive assistant for networks)  predictive maintainence tool on any Kubernetes based cloud environment.\n\nAvanseus Cognitive Assistant for Networks (CAN), applies AI and machine learning to predict where a network is likely to fail next, and what to do before it happens.  CAN operator bundles CAN, CAS, LDAP, VBI, Prediction controller & Prediction worker applications.\n\nSupporting links:\n- [CAN operator prerequisite & configuration](https://avanseuscandev.com/releases/CAN/5.5/redhat/CAN_redhat_openshift_operator_installation.pdf): This is similar to the content mentioned from next section\n- [Password encryption](https://avanseuscandev.com/releases/CAN/5.5/redhat/CAN_password_encryption.pdf):  Utility guide for encrypting password texts\n- [CAN user manual](https://avanseuscandev.com/releases/CAN/5.5/Release/CAN_5.5_User_Manual.pdf)\n- [CAN operator installation video](https://avanseuscandev.com/releases/CAN/5.5/Videos/can-operator-openshift-installation-guide.mp4)\n\n# Operator installation\nMentioned below are the pre-requisites & configuration steps to be followed to install the CAN operator.\n### Before you start\n\n - A MongoDB instance must be available to connect to from the pods. This is usually provided by the \nenterprise customer. If not, then this has to be installed separately.\n - An initial MongoDB data dump needs to be loaded in the database. Please contact [Avanseus \ndelivery](mailto:support@avanseus.com).\n - In case, LDAP is not provided by the customer, [Avanseus delivery](mailto:support@avanseus.com) team can be requested to\n provide a LDAP image which is essential for Web dashboard authentication.\n - Binary files of applications does not come as part of the operator. These need to be requested from [Avanseus delivery](mailto:support@avanseus.com) team.\n - Create a project, service account & configure that service account using the below commands\n   \n   ```sh\n   \n   oc new-project <PROJECT_OR_NAMESPACE>\n   \n   oc create sa avanseus\n   \n   oc adm policy add-scc-to-user anyuid system:serviceaccount:<PROJECT_OR_NAMESPACE>:avanseus\n   \n   ```\n   \n   Replace `<PROJECT_OR_NAMESPACE>` with relevant namespace where the configurations provided in the `Configuration prerequisites` section below will be done & also where the operator would be installed.\n   \n   \n\nAvanseus delivery team can be contacted  at <support@avanseus.com>.\nMentioned below are the prerequisite configurations required for installing CAN operator. \n## Third party software pre-requisites\nTable shown below, specifies the supported versions of the third party software or protocol.\n<table><tr><th>Compatible software/protocol</th><th>Supported version</th></tr><tr><td>MongoDB</td><td>v4.4.5</td></tr><tr><td>LDAP protocol</td><td>Version-3</td></tr><tr><td>Memcached</td><td>1.5</td></tr></table>\n\n### Third party software availability\n- ***MongoDB with initial data***\n\n  For the CAN application to come up successfully, it needs some initial data in MongoDB.\n  However if it is not available, then [Avanseus delivery](mailto:support@avanseus.com) team needs \n  to be contacted for an initial data dump that needs to be imported to a MongoDB schema. MongoDB \n  can either be within the Openshift platform or outside. This MongoDB schema must be accessible from the \n  CAN operator pods preferably on port 27017. \n  \n- ***LDAP with initial user data***\n\n  For the CAN application, authentication is made possible using LDAP. Usually customers provide an LDAP connection for integration. However, if LDAP is not made available by the customer, then a LDAP\npod comes as part of operator installation by default with one initial user. [Avanseus delivery](mailto:support@avanseus.com) team needs to be requested to get the user access details. \n  If customer provides LDAP, then it can be outside Openshift or within the cluster. The LDAP Host and port details must be configured in a ConfigMap.\n  \n- ***Memcached***\n\n  Memcached is used by CAN to cache small data for fast retrieval. This is also used for tomcat session replication. This application comes by default with the operator.\n\n\n## Configuration prerequisites\n\n### PersistentVolumeClaim to copy WAR files\nBy default, the CAN operator does not come with CAN binary. [Avanseus delivery](mailto:support@avanseus.com) team must be requested to obtain the WAR files. Before deploying, the binaries in need to be obtained and put into a PersistentVolume. Mentioned below is a method to do this.\n\nThese binaries are:\n\n\n - CAN.war\n - CAS.war\n - PredictionController.war\n - universal\n\n\nCreate a PersistentVolumeClaim \"tmp-data\". Mentioned below is an example configuration YAML\n```sh\nkind: PersistentVolumeClaim\napiVersion: v1\nmetadata:\n name: tmp-data\nspec:\n accessModes:\n - ReadWriteOnce\n resources:\n  requests:\n   storage: 1G\n\n```\nCreate a dummy application (Apache server) and mount the created PersistentVolumeClaim. Mentioned below is the YAML content\n```sh\napiVersion: v1\nkind: Pod\nmetadata:\n name: pod-httpd\n labels:\n  app: apache_webserver\nspec:\n containers:\n - name: cntr-httpd\n   image: httpd:latest\n   ports:\n   - containerPort: 80\n   volumeMounts:\n   - mountPath: /mnt\n     name: tmp-data\n volumes:\n - name: tmp-data\n   persistentVolumeClaim:\n    claimName: tmp-data\n\n```\nChange directory to the place where WAR files are available. Copy the WAR files provided by Avanseus into the mount point \"/mnt\" using the rsync command.\n```sh\noc rsync . pod-httpd:/mnt\n```\nOnce this is done, the dummy application pod can be stopped. Remember that \"tmp-data\" PersistentVolume must not be deleted as this is used by Operator components to pull the binaries.\n### PersistentVolumeClaim for CAN application\nCreate a PersistentVolumeClaim named \"candatapvc\" & \"canlogpvc\". This is needed for the CAN application to write files.  YAML configuration is given below.\n```sh\nkind: PersistentVolumeClaim\napiVersion: v1\nmetadata:\n name: candatapvc\nspec:\n accessModes:\n - ReadWriteOnce\nresources:\n requests:\n  storage: 5G\n\n---\n\nkind: PersistentVolumeClaim\napiVersion: v1\nmetadata:\n name: canlogpvc\nspec:\n accessModes:\n - ReadWriteOnce\nresources:\n requests:\n  storage: 5G\n\n```\n### PesistentVolumeClaim for LDAP application\nCreate a PersistentVolumeClaim named \"ldap-storage\". This is needed for LDAP module to store the user DB data in a persistent location. YAML configuration is given below.\n```sh\nkind: PersistentVolumeClaim\napiVersion: v1\nmetadata:\n name: ldap-storage\nspec:\n accessModes:\n - ReadWriteOnce\nresources:\n requests:\n  storage: 5G\n\n```\n\n### Config Maps\nPods within the operator need configurations to startup the application. These configurations have to be stored in Config maps on Openshift platform.\nCAN operator comes with 5 applications which would run in 5 different pods:\n - CAN (Needs config map)\n - LDAP\n - VBI\n - Prediction controller (Needs config map)\n - Prediction worker\n\n### CAN config map (``canconfig``)\n\nMentioned below are the ConfigMap entries CAN application needs & hence create 3 files mentioned below:\n#### ``catalina.properties`` - Catalina file for tomcat:\n```sh\n# Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one or more\n# contributor license agreements.

CAN operator bundles CAN, CAS, LDAP, VBI, Prediction controller & Prediction worker applications.\n\nSupporting links:\n- [CAN operator prerequisite & configuration](https://avanseuscandev.com/releases/CAN/5.5/redhat/CAN_redhat_openshift_operator_installation.pdf): This is similar to the content mentioned from next section\n- [Password encryption](https://avanseuscandev.com/releases/CAN/5.5/redhat/CAN_password_encryption.pdf):  Utility guide for encrypting password texts\n- [CAN user manual](https://avanseuscandev.com/releases/CAN/5.5/Release/CAN_5.5_User_Manual.pdf)\n- [CAN operator installation video](https://avanseuscandev.com/releases/CAN/5.5/Videos/can-operator-openshift-installation-guide.mp4)\n\n# Operator installation\nMentioned below are the pre-requisites & configuration steps to be followed to install the CAN operator.\n### Before you start\n\n - A MongoDB instance must be available to connect to from the pods. This is usually provided by the \nenterprise customer. If not, then this has to be installed separately.\n - An initial MongoDB data dump needs to be loaded in the database. Please contact [Avanseus \ndelivery](mailto:support@avanseus.com).\n - In case, LDAP is not provided by the customer, [Avanseus delivery](mailto:support@avanseus.com) team can be requested to\n provide a LDAP image which is essential for Web dashboard authentication.\n - Binary files of applications does not come as part of the operator. These need to be requested from [Avanseus delivery](mailto:support@avanseus.com) team.\n - Create a project, service account & configure that service account using the below commands\n   \n   ```sh\n   \n   oc new-project <PROJECT_OR_NAMESPACE>\n   \n   oc create sa avanseus\n   \n   oc adm policy add-scc-to-user anyuid system:serviceaccount:<PROJECT_OR_NAMESPACE>:avanseus\n   \n   ```\n   \n   Replace `<PROJECT_OR_NAMESPACE>` with relevant namespace where the configurations provided in the `Configuration prerequisites` section below will be done & also where the operator would be installed.\n   \n   \n\nAvanseus delivery team can be contacted  at <support@avanseus.com>.\nMentioned below are the prerequisite configurations required for installing CAN operator. \n## Third party software pre-requisites\nTable shown below, specifies the supported versions of the third party software or protocol.\n<table><tr><th>Compatible software/protocol</th><th>Supported version</th></tr><tr><td>MongoDB</td><td>v4.4.5</td></tr><tr><td>LDAP protocol</td><td>Version-3</td></tr><tr><td>Memcached</td><td>1.5</td></tr></table>\n\n### Third party software availability\n- ***MongoDB with initial data***\n\n  For the CAN application to come up successfully, it needs some initial data in MongoDB.\n  However if it is not available, then [Avanseus delivery](mailto:support@avanseus.com) team needs \n  to be contacted for an initial data dump that needs to be imported to a MongoDB schema. MongoDB \n  can either be within the Openshift platform or outside. This MongoDB schema must be accessible from the \n  CAN operator pods preferably on port 27017. \n  \n- ***LDAP with initial user data***\n\n  For the CAN application, authentication is made possible using LDAP. Usually customers provide an LDAP connection for integration. However, if LDAP is not made available by the customer, then a LDAP\npod comes as part of operator installation by default with one initial user. [Avanseus delivery](mailto:support@avanseus.com) team needs to be requested to get the user access details. \n  If customer provides LDAP, then it can be outside Openshift or within the cluster. The LDAP Host and port details must be configured in a ConfigMap.\n  \n- ***Memcached***\n\n  Memcached is used by CAN to cache small data for fast retrieval. This is also used for tomcat session replication. This application comes by default with the operator.\n\n\n## Configuration prerequisites\n\n### PersistentVolumeClaim to copy WAR files\nBy default, the CAN operator does not come with CAN binary. [Avanseus delivery](mailto:support@avanseus.com) team must be requested to obtain the WAR files. Before deploying, the binaries in need to be obtained and put into a PersistentVolume. Mentioned below is a method to do this.\n\nThese binaries are:\n\n\n - CAN.war\n - CAS.war\n - PredictionController.war\n - universal\n\n\nCreate a PersistentVolumeClaim \"tmp-data\". Mentioned below is an example configuration YAML\n```sh\nkind: PersistentVolumeClaim\napiVersion: v1\nmetadata:\n name: tmp-data\nspec:\n accessModes:\n - ReadWriteOnce\n resources:\n  requests:\n   storage: 1G\n\n```\nCreate a dummy application (Apache server) and mount the created PersistentVolumeClaim. Mentioned below is the YAML content\n```sh\napiVersion: v1\nkind: Pod\nmetadata:\n name: pod-httpd\n labels:\n  app: apache_webserver\nspec:\n containers:\n - name: cntr-httpd\n   image: httpd:latest\n   ports:\n   - containerPort: 80\n   volumeMounts:\n   - mountPath: /mnt\n     name: tmp-data\n volumes:\n - name: tmp-data\n   persistentVolumeClaim:\n    claimName: tmp-data\n\n```\nChange directory to the place where WAR files are available. Copy the WAR files provided by Avanseus into the mount point \"/mnt\" using the rsync command.\n```sh\noc rsync . pod-httpd:/mnt\n```\nOnce this is done, the dummy application pod can be stopped. Remember that \"tmp-data\" PersistentVolume must not be deleted as this is used by Operator components to pull the binaries.\n### PersistentVolumeClaim for CAN application\nCreate a PersistentVolumeClaim named \"candatapvc\" & \"canlogpvc\". This is needed for the CAN application to write files.  YAML configuration is given below.\n```sh\nkind: PersistentVolumeClaim\napiVersion: v1\nmetadata:\n name: candatapvc\nspec:\n accessModes:\n - ReadWriteOnce\nresources:\n requests:\n  storage: 5G\n\n---\n\nkind: PersistentVolumeClaim\napiVersion: v1\nmetadata:\n name: canlogpvc\nspec:\n accessModes:\n - ReadWriteOnce\nresources:\n requests:\n  storage: 5G\n\n```\n### PesistentVolumeClaim for LDAP application\nCreate a PersistentVolumeClaim named \"ldap-storage\". This is needed for LDAP module to store the user DB data in a persistent location. YAML configuration is given below.\n```sh\nkind: PersistentVolumeClaim\napiVersion: v1\nmetadata:\n name: ldap-storage\nspec:\n accessModes:\n - ReadWriteOnce\nresources:\n requests:\n  storage: 5G\n\n```\n\n### Config Maps\nPods within the operator need configurations to startup the application. These configurations have to be stored in Config maps on Openshift platform.\nCAN operator comes with 5 applications which would run in 5 different pods:\n - CAN (Needs config map)\n - LDAP\n - VBI\n - Prediction controller (Needs config map)\n - Prediction worker\n\n### CAN config map (``canconfig``)\n\nMentioned below are the ConfigMap entries CAN application needs & hence create 3 files mentioned below:\n#### ``catalina.properties`` - Catalina file for tomcat:\n```sh\n# Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one or more\n# contributor license agreements.

      "csv_description": "# Overview\nThe Avanseus CAN operator deploys and manages the CAN (Cognitive assistant for networks)  predictive maintainence tool on any Kubernetes based cloud environment.\n\nAvanseus Cognitive Assistant for Networks (CAN), applies AI and machine learning to predict where a network is likely to fail next, and what to do before it happens.  CAN operator bundles CAN, CAS, LDAP, VBI, Prediction controller & Prediction worker applications.\n\nSupporting links:\n- [CAN operator prerequisite & configuration](https://avanseuscandev.com/releases/CAN/5.5/redhat/CAN_redhat_openshift_operator_installation.pdf): This is similar to the content mentioned from next section\n- [Password encryption](https://avanseuscandev.com/releases/CAN/5.5/redhat/CAN_password_encryption.pdf):  Utility guide for encrypting password texts\n- [CAN user manual](https://avanseuscandev.com/releases/CAN/5.5/Release/CAN_5.5_User_Manual.pdf)\n- [CAN operator installation video](https://avanseuscandev.com/releases/CAN/5.5/Videos/can-operator-openshift-installation-guide.mp4)\n\n# Operator installation\nMentioned below are the pre-requisites & configuration steps to be followed to install the CAN operator.\n### Before you start\n\n - A MongoDB instance must be available to connect to from the pods. This is usually provided by the \nenterprise customer. If not, then this has to be installed separately.\n - An initial MongoDB data dump needs to be loaded in the database. Please contact [Avanseus \ndelivery](mailto:support@avanseus.com).\n - In case, LDAP is not provided by the customer, [Avanseus delivery](mailto:support@avanseus.com) team can be requested to\n provide a LDAP image which is essential for Web dashboard authentication.\n - Binary files of applications does not come as part of the operator. These need to be requested from [Avanseus delivery](mailto:support@avanseus.com) team.\n - Create a project, service account & configure that service account using the below commands\n   \n   ```sh\n   \n   oc new-project <PROJECT_OR_NAMESPACE>\n   \n   oc create sa avanseus\n   \n   oc adm policy add-scc-to-user anyuid system:serviceaccount:<PROJECT_OR_NAMESPACE>:avanseus\n   \n   ```\n   \n   Replace `<PROJECT_OR_NAMESPACE>` with relevant namespace where the configurations provided in the `Configuration prerequisites` section below will be done & also where the operator would be installed.\n   \n   \n\nAvanseus delivery team can be contacted  at <support@avanseus.com>.\nMentioned below are the prerequisite configurations required for installing CAN operator. \n## Third party software pre-requisites\nTable shown below, specifies the supported versions of the third party software or protocol.\n<table><tr><th>Compatible software/protocol</th><th>Supported version</th></tr><tr><td>MongoDB</td><td>v4.4.5</td></tr><tr><td>LDAP protocol</td><td>Version-3</td></tr><tr><td>Memcached</td><td>1.5</td></tr></table>\n\n### Third party software availability\n- ***MongoDB with initial data***\n\n  For the CAN application to come up successfully, it needs some initial data in MongoDB.\n  However if it is not available, then [Avanseus delivery](mailto:support@avanseus.com) team needs \n  to be contacted for an initial data dump that needs to be imported to a MongoDB schema. MongoDB \n  can either be within the Openshift platform or outside. This MongoDB schema must be accessible from the \n  CAN operator pods preferably on port 27017. \n  \n- ***LDAP with initial user data***\n\n  For the CAN application, authentication is made possible using LDAP. Usually customers provide an LDAP connection for integration. However, if LDAP is not made available by the customer, then a LDAP\npod comes as part of operator installation by default with one initial user. [Avanseus delivery](mailto:support@avanseus.com) team needs to be requested to get the user access details. \n  If customer provides LDAP, then it can be outside Openshift or within the cluster. The LDAP Host and port details must be configured in a ConfigMap.\n  \n- ***Memcached***\n\n  Memcached is used by CAN to cache small data for fast retrieval. This is also used for tomcat session replication. This application comes by default with the operator.\n\n\n## Configuration prerequisites\n\n### PersistentVolumeClaim to copy WAR files\nBy default, the CAN operator does not come with CAN binary. [Avanseus delivery](mailto:support@avanseus.com) team must be requested to obtain the WAR files. Before deploying, the binaries in need to be obtained and put into a PersistentVolume. Mentioned below is a method to do this.\n\nThese binaries are:\n\n\n - CAN.war\n - CAS.war\n - PredictionController.war\n - universal\n\n\nCreate a PersistentVolumeClaim \"tmp-data\". Mentioned below is an example configuration YAML\n```sh\nkind: PersistentVolumeClaim\napiVersion: v1\nmetadata:\n name: tmp-data\nspec:\n accessModes:\n - ReadWriteOnce\n resources:\n  requests:\n   storage: 1G\n\n```\nCreate a dummy application (Apache server) and mount the created PersistentVolumeClaim. Mentioned below is the YAML content\n```sh\napiVersion: v1\nkind: Pod\nmetadata:\n name: pod-httpd\n labels:\n  app: apache_webserver\nspec:\n containers:\n - name: cntr-httpd\n   image: httpd:latest\n   ports:\n   - containerPort: 80\n   volumeMounts:\n   - mountPath: /mnt\n     name: tmp-data\n volumes:\n - name: tmp-data\n   persistentVolumeClaim:\n    claimName: tmp-data\n\n```\nChange directory to the place where WAR files are available. Copy the WAR files provided by Avanseus into the mount point \"/mnt\" using the rsync command.\n```sh\noc rsync . pod-httpd:/mnt\n```\nOnce this is done, the dummy application pod can be stopped. Remember that \"tmp-data\" PersistentVolume must not be deleted as this is used by Operator components to pull the binaries.\n### PersistentVolumeClaim for CAN application\nCreate a PersistentVolumeClaim named \"candatapvc\" & \"canlogpvc\". This is needed for the CAN application to write files.  YAML configuration is given below.\n```sh\nkind: PersistentVolumeClaim\napiVersion: v1\nmetadata:\n name: candatapvc\nspec:\n accessModes:\n - ReadWriteOnce\nresources:\n requests:\n  storage: 5G\n\n---\n\nkind: PersistentVolumeClaim\napiVersion: v1\nmetadata:\n name: canlogpvc\nspec:\n accessModes:\n - ReadWriteOnce\nresources:\n requests:\n  storage: 5G\n\n```\n### PesistentVolumeClaim for LDAP application\nCreate a PersistentVolumeClaim named \"ldap-storage\". This is needed for LDAP module to store the user DB data in a persistent location. YAML configuration is given below.\n```sh\nkind: PersistentVolumeClaim\napiVersion: v1\nmetadata:\n name: ldap-storage\nspec:\n accessModes:\n - ReadWriteOnce\nresources:\n requests:\n  storage: 5G\n\n```\n\n### Config Maps\nPods within the operator need configurations to startup the application. These configurations have to be stored in Config maps on Openshift platform.\nCAN operator comes with 5 applications which would run in 5 different pods:\n - CAN (Needs config map)\n - LDAP\n - VBI\n - Prediction controller (Needs config map)\n - Prediction worker\n\n### CAN config map (``canconfig``)\n\nMentioned below are the ConfigMap entries CAN application needs & hence create 3 files mentioned below:\n#### ``catalina.properties`` - Catalina file for tomcat:\n```sh\n# Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one or more\n# contributor license agreements.

Mentioned below is a link to the video which shows how to install the CAN operator.\n\n[CAN operator installation video](https://avanseuscandev.com/releases/CAN/5.5/Videos/can-operator-openshift-installation-guide.mp4)\n\n## Post installation\nAfter installation, CAN application would be available on following URL:\n```sh\nhttps://can-<NAMESPACE>.<ROUTER_DEFAULT_HOSTNAME>/CAN/\n```\nIf CAN tool was integrated with LDAP on customer premise, then the user credentials would be known. If CAN tool was integrated with Avanseus's default LDAP, then request the [Avanseus delivery](mailto:support@avanseus.com) team for credentials.\n",

GitLab Runner works in conjunction with GitLab CI/CD, the open-source continuous integration service included with GitLab.\n\nThe GitLab Runner operator manages the lifecycle of GitLab Runner in Kubernetes or Openshift clusters. The operator aims to automate the tasks needed to run your CI/CD jobs in your container orchestration platform.\n\n## Usage\n\n To link a GitLab Runner instance to a self-hosted GitLab instance or the hosted [GitLab](https://gitlab.com), you first need to:\n\n 1. create a secret containing the `runner-registration-token` from your GitLab project.\n\n   ```\n  cat > gitlab-runner-secret.yml << EOF\n  apiVersion: v1\n  kind: Secret\n  metadata:\n    name: gitlab-runner-secret\n  type: Opaque\n  stringData:\n    runner-registration-token: REPLACE_ME # your project runner secret\n  EOF\n  ```\n\n  ```\n  oc apply -f gitlab-runner-secret.yml\n  ```\n\n 2. Create the Custom Resource Definition (CRD) file and include the following information. The tags value must be openshift for the job to run.\n\n   ```\n   cat > gitlab-runner.yml << EOF\n   apiVersion: apps.gitlab.com/v1beta2\n   kind: Runner\n   metadata:\n     name: gitlab-runner\n   spec:\n     gitlabUrl: https://gitlab.example.com\n     buildImage: alpine\n     token: gitlab-runner-secret\n     tags: openshift\n   EOF\n   ```\n\n  ```\n  oc apply -f gitlab-runner.yml\n  ```\n\n## Full documentation\n\nVisit [Install GitLab Runner on Red Hat OpenShift](https://docs.gitlab.com/runner/install/openshift.html)\n",

The NeuVector operator contains all necessary information to deploy NeuVector using helm charts. You simply need to install the NeuVector operator from the OpenShift embeded operator hub and create NeuVector instance. You can modify the NeuVector installation configuration by modifying yaml while creating the NeuVector instance such as imagePullSecrets, tag version, etc. Please refer to [github link](https://github.com/neuvector/neuvector-helm/tree/master/charts/core) for the values that can be modifed during installation. To upgrade to a newer version of NeuVector, just reapply the NeuVector instance with desired tag , which in turn pulls the specified NeuVector image tags and upgrades as per upgrade plan configured on the helm chart.  NeuVector Operator versions are tied to NeuVector product versions. Version 1.2.9 of the NeuVector Certified Operator deploys version 4.3.1 of NeuVector.\n\n**Complete below steps to Grant Service Account Access to the Privileged SCC before installation.**\n\nCreate the NeuVector namespace\n\n         oc new-project  neuvector\nLogin as system:admin account\n\n         oc login -u system:admin\n\nGrant Service Account Access to the Privileged SCC\n\n         oc -n neuvector adm policy add-scc-to-user privileged -z default\n\nThe following info will be added in the Privileged SCC users:\n\n         - system:serviceaccount:neuvector:default\n\nIn OpenShift 4.6+ use the following to check:\n\n         oc get rolebinding system:openshift:scc:privileged -n neuvector -o wide\n         NAME                              ROLE                                          AGE     USERS   GROUPS   SERVICEACCOUNTS\n         system:openshift:scc:privileged   ClusterRole/system:openshift:scc:privileged   9m22s                    neuvector/default\n\n\n**Add NeuVector license from NeuVector WebUI->setting**\n\n\n#Deploying the NeuVector Operator#\n\n\nPlease refer to the instructions [here](https://github.com/neuvector/neuvector-operator/blob/master/README.md)\n\n\n",

The NeuVector operator contains all necessary information to deploy NeuVector using helm charts. You simply need to install the NeuVector operator from the OpenShift embeded operator hub and create NeuVector instance. You can modify the NeuVector installation configuration by modifying yaml while creating the NeuVector instance such as imagePullSecrets, tag version, etc. Please refer to [github link](https://github.com/neuvector/neuvector-helm/tree/master/charts/core) for the values that can be modifed during installation. To upgrade to a newer version of NeuVector, just reapply the NeuVector instance with desired tag , which in turn pulls the specified NeuVector image tags and upgrades as per upgrade plan configured on the helm chart.  NeuVector Operator versions are tied to NeuVector product versions. Version 1.2.9 of the NeuVector Certified Operator deploys version 4.3.1 of NeuVector.\n\n**Complete below steps to Grant Service Account Access to the Privileged SCC before installation.**\n\nCreate the NeuVector namespace\n\n         oc new-project  neuvector\nLogin as system:admin account\n\n         oc login -u system:admin\n\nGrant Service Account Access to the Privileged SCC\n\n         oc -n neuvector adm policy add-scc-to-user privileged -z default\n\nThe following info will be added in the Privileged SCC users:\n\n         - system:serviceaccount:neuvector:default\n\nIn OpenShift 4.6+ use the following to check:\n\n         oc get rolebinding system:openshift:scc:privileged -n neuvector -o wide\n         NAME                              ROLE                                          AGE     USERS   GROUPS   SERVICEACCOUNTS\n         system:openshift:scc:privileged   ClusterRole/system:openshift:scc:privileged   9m22s                    neuvector/default\n\n\n**Add NeuVector license from NeuVector WebUI->setting**\n\n\n#Deploying the NeuVector Operator#\n\n\nPlease refer to the instructions [here](https://github.com/neuvector/neuvector-operator/blob/master/README.md)\n\n\n",

The NeuVector operator contains all necessary information to deploy NeuVector using helm charts. You simply need to install the NeuVector operator from the OpenShift embeded operator hub and create NeuVector instance. You can modify the NeuVector installation configuration by modifying yaml while creating the NeuVector instance such as imagePullSecrets, tag version, etc. Please refer to [github link](https://github.com/neuvector/neuvector-helm/tree/master/charts/core) for the values that can be modifed during installation. To upgrade to a newer version of NeuVector, just reapply the NeuVector instance with desired tag , which in turn pulls the specified NeuVector image tags and upgrades as per upgrade plan configured on the helm chart.  NeuVector Operator versions are tied to NeuVector product versions. Version 1.2.9 of the NeuVector Certified Operator deploys version 4.3.1 of NeuVector.\n\n**Complete below steps to Grant Service Account Access to the Privileged SCC before installation.**\n\nCreate the NeuVector namespace\n\n         oc new-project  neuvector\nLogin as system:admin account\n\n         oc login -u system:admin\n\nGrant Service Account Access to the Privileged SCC\n\n         oc -n neuvector adm policy add-scc-to-user privileged -z default\n\nThe following info will be added in the Privileged SCC users:\n\n         - system:serviceaccount:neuvector:default\n\nIn OpenShift 4.6+ use the following to check:\n\n         oc get rolebinding system:openshift:scc:privileged -n neuvector -o wide\n         NAME                              ROLE                                          AGE     USERS   GROUPS   SERVICEACCOUNTS\n         system:openshift:scc:privileged   ClusterRole/system:openshift:scc:privileged   9m22s                    neuvector/default\n\n\n**Add NeuVector license from NeuVector WebUI->setting**\n\n\n#Deploying the NeuVector Operator#\n\n\nPlease refer to the instructions [here](https://github.com/neuvector/neuvector-operator/blob/master/README.md)\n\n\n",

The NeuVector operator contains all necessary information to deploy NeuVector using helm charts. You simply need to install the NeuVector operator from the OpenShift embeded operator hub and create NeuVector instance. You can modify the NeuVector installation configuration by modifying yaml while creating the NeuVector instance such as imagePullSecrets, tag version, etc. Please refer to [github link](https://github.com/neuvector/neuvector-helm/tree/master/charts/core) for the values that can be modifed during installation. To upgrade to a newer version of NeuVector, just reapply the NeuVector instance with desired tag , which in turn pulls the specified NeuVector image tags and upgrades as per upgrade plan configured on the helm chart.  NeuVector Operator versions are tied to NeuVector product versions. Version 1.2.9 of the NeuVector Certified Operator deploys version 4.3.1 of NeuVector.\n\n**Complete below steps to Grant Service Account Access to the Privileged SCC before installation.**\n\nCreate the NeuVector namespace\n\n         oc new-project  neuvector\nLogin as system:admin account\n\n         oc login -u system:admin\n\nGrant Service Account Access to the Privileged SCC\n\n         oc -n neuvector adm policy add-scc-to-user privileged -z default\n\nThe following info will be added in the Privileged SCC users:\n\n         - system:serviceaccount:neuvector:default\n\nIn OpenShift 4.6+ use the following to check:\n\n         oc get rolebinding system:openshift:scc:privileged -n neuvector -o wide\n         NAME                              ROLE                                          AGE     USERS   GROUPS   SERVICEACCOUNTS\n         system:openshift:scc:privileged   ClusterRole/system:openshift:scc:privileged   9m22s                    neuvector/default\n\n\n**Add NeuVector license from NeuVector WebUI->setting**\n\n\n#Deploying the NeuVector Operator#\n\n\nPlease refer to the instructions [here](https://github.com/neuvector/neuvector-operator/blob/master/README.md)\n\n\n",

The NeuVector operator contains all necessary information to deploy NeuVector using helm charts. You simply need to install the NeuVector operator from the OpenShift embeded operator hub and create NeuVector instance. You can modify the NeuVector installation configuration by modifying yaml while creating the NeuVector instance such as imagePullSecrets, tag version, etc. Please refer to [github link](https://github.com/neuvector/neuvector-helm/tree/master/charts/core) for the values that can be modifed during installation. To upgrade to a newer version of NeuVector, just reapply the NeuVector instance with desired tag , which in turn pulls the specified NeuVector image tags and upgrades as per upgrade plan configured on the helm chart.  NeuVector Operator versions are tied to NeuVector product versions. Version 1.2.9 of the NeuVector Certified Operator deploys version 4.3.1 of NeuVector.\n\n**Complete below steps to Grant Service Account Access to the Privileged SCC before installation.**\n\nCreate the NeuVector namespace\n\n         oc new-project  neuvector\nLogin as system:admin account\n\n         oc login -u system:admin\n\nGrant Service Account Access to the Privileged SCC\n\n         oc -n neuvector adm policy add-scc-to-user privileged -z default\n\nThe following info will be added in the Privileged SCC users:\n\n         - system:serviceaccount:neuvector:default\n\nIn OpenShift 4.6+ use the following to check:\n\n         oc get rolebinding system:openshift:scc:privileged -n neuvector -o wide\n         NAME                              ROLE                                          AGE     USERS   GROUPS   SERVICEACCOUNTS\n         system:openshift:scc:privileged   ClusterRole/system:openshift:scc:privileged   9m22s                    neuvector/default\n\n\n**Add NeuVector license from NeuVector WebUI->setting**\n\n\n#Deploying the NeuVector Operator#\n\n\nPlease refer to the instructions [here](https://github.com/neuvector/neuvector-operator/blob/master/README.md)\n\n\n",
