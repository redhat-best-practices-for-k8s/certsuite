The NeuVector operator contains all necessary information to deploy NeuVector using helm charts. You simply need to install the NeuVector operator from the OpenShift embeded operator hub and create NeuVector instance. You can modify the NeuVector installation configuration by modifying yaml while creating the NeuVector instance such as imagePullSecrets, tag version, etc. Please refer to [github link](https://github.com/neuvector/neuvector-helm/tree/master/charts/core) for the values that can be modifed during installation. To upgrade to a newer version of NeuVector, just reapply the NeuVector instance with desired tag , which in turn pulls the specified NeuVector image tags and upgrades as per upgrade plan configured on the helm chart.  NeuVector Operator versions are tied to NeuVector product versions. Version 1.3.1 of the NeuVector Certified Operator deploys version 4.3.2-s1 of NeuVector.\n\n**Complete below steps to Grant Service Account Access to the Privileged SCC before installation.**\n\nCreate the NeuVector namespace\n\n         oc new-project  neuvector\nLogin as system:admin account\n\n         oc login -u system:admin\n\nGrant Service Account Access to the Privileged SCC\n\n         oc -n neuvector adm policy add-scc-to-user privileged -z default\n\nThe following info will be added in the Privileged SCC users:\n\n         - system:serviceaccount:neuvector:default\n\nIn OpenShift 4.6+ use the following to check:\n\n         oc get rolebinding system:openshift:scc:privileged -n neuvector -o wide\n         system:openshift:scc:privileged   ClusterRole/system:openshift:scc:privileged   9m22s                    neuvector/default\n\n\n**Add NeuVector license from NeuVector WebUI->setting**\n\n\n#Deploying the NeuVector Operator#\n\n\nPlease refer to the instructions [here](https://github.com/neuvector/neuvector-operator/blob/master/README.md)\n\n\n",

However, configuring and managing nodes with these hardware resources requires configuration of multiple software components such as drivers, container runtimes or other libraries which are difficult and prone to errors.\nThe NVIDIA GPU Operator uses the [operator framework](https://coreos.com/blog/introducing-operator-framework) within Kubernetes to automate the management of all NVIDIA software components needed to provision and monitor GPUs. These components include the NVIDIA drivers (to enable CUDA), Kubernetes device plugin for GPUs, the NVIDIA Container Runtime, automatic node labelling and NVIDIA DCGM exporter.\nVisit the official site of the [GPU Operator](https://github.com/NVIDIA/gpu-operator) for more information. For getting started with using the GPU Operator with OpenShift, see the instructions [here](https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/kubernetes/openshift-on-gpu-install-guide/index.html).\n",

The NeuVector operator contains all necessary information to deploy NeuVector using helm charts. You simply need to install the NeuVector operator from the OpenShift embeded operator hub and create NeuVector instance. You can modify the NeuVector installation configuration by modifying yaml while creating the NeuVector instance such as imagePullSecrets, tag version, etc. Please refer to [github link](https://github.com/neuvector/neuvector-helm/tree/master/charts/core) for the values that can be modifed during installation. To upgrade to a newer version of NeuVector, just reapply the NeuVector instance with desired tag , which in turn pulls the specified NeuVector image tags and upgrades as per upgrade plan configured on the helm chart.  NeuVector Operator versions are tied to NeuVector product versions. Version 1.3.1 of the NeuVector Certified Operator deploys version 4.3.2-s1 of NeuVector.\n\n**Complete below steps to Grant Service Account Access to the Privileged SCC before installation.**\n\nCreate the NeuVector namespace\n\n         oc new-project  neuvector\nLogin as system:admin account\n\n         oc login -u system:admin\n\nGrant Service Account Access to the Privileged SCC\n\n         oc -n neuvector adm policy add-scc-to-user privileged -z default\n\nThe following info will be added in the Privileged SCC users:\n\n         - system:serviceaccount:neuvector:default\n\nIn OpenShift 4.6+ use the following to check:\n\n         oc get rolebinding system:openshift:scc:privileged -n neuvector -o wide\n         system:openshift:scc:privileged   ClusterRole/system:openshift:scc:privileged   9m22s                    neuvector/default\n\n\n**Add NeuVector license from NeuVector WebUI->setting**\n\n\n#Deploying the NeuVector Operator#\n\n\nPlease refer to the instructions [here](https://github.com/neuvector/neuvector-operator/blob/master/README.md)\n\n\n",

However, configuring and managing nodes with these hardware resources requires configuration of multiple software components such as drivers, container runtimes or other libraries which are difficult and prone to errors.\nThe NVIDIA GPU Operator uses the [operator framework](https://coreos.com/blog/introducing-operator-framework) within Kubernetes to automate the management of all NVIDIA software components needed to provision and monitor GPUs. These components include the NVIDIA drivers (to enable CUDA), Kubernetes device plugin for GPUs, the NVIDIA Container Runtime, automatic node labelling and NVIDIA DCGM exporter.\nVisit the official site of the [GPU Operator](https://github.com/NVIDIA/gpu-operator) for more information. For getting started with using the GPU Operator with OpenShift, see the instructions [here](https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/kubernetes/openshift-on-gpu-install-guide/index.html).\n",

The NeuVector operator contains all necessary information to deploy NeuVector using helm charts. You simply need to install the NeuVector operator from the OpenShift embeded operator hub and create NeuVector instance. You can modify the NeuVector installation configuration by modifying yaml while creating the NeuVector instance such as imagePullSecrets, tag version, etc. Please refer to [github link](https://github.com/neuvector/neuvector-helm/tree/master/charts/core) for the values that can be modifed during installation. To upgrade to a newer version of NeuVector, just reapply the NeuVector instance with desired tag , which in turn pulls the specified NeuVector image tags and upgrades as per upgrade plan configured on the helm chart.  NeuVector Operator versions are tied to NeuVector product versions. Version 1.3.1 of the NeuVector Certified Operator deploys version 4.3.2-s1 of NeuVector.\n\n**Complete below steps to Grant Service Account Access to the Privileged SCC before installation.**\n\nCreate the NeuVector namespace\n\n         oc new-project  neuvector\nLogin as system:admin account\n\n         oc login -u system:admin\n\nGrant Service Account Access to the Privileged SCC\n\n         oc -n neuvector adm policy add-scc-to-user privileged -z default\n\nThe following info will be added in the Privileged SCC users:\n\n         - system:serviceaccount:neuvector:default\n\nIn OpenShift 4.6+ use the following to check:\n\n         oc get rolebinding system:openshift:scc:privileged -n neuvector -o wide\n         system:openshift:scc:privileged   ClusterRole/system:openshift:scc:privileged   9m22s                    neuvector/default\n\n\n**Add NeuVector license from NeuVector WebUI->setting**\n\n\n#Deploying the NeuVector Operator#\n\n\nPlease refer to the instructions [here](https://github.com/neuvector/neuvector-operator/blob/master/README.md)\n\n\n",

      "csv_description": "This advanced Operator is capable of deploying any runtime component image with consistent, production-grade QoS. It enables enterprise architects to govern the way their applications get deployed & managed in the cluster, while dramatically reducing the learning curve for developers to deploy into Kubernetes - allowing them to focus on writing the code!\nHere are some key features:\n\n#### Application Lifecyle\nYou can deploy your runtime component container by either pointing to a container image, or an OpenShift ImageStream. When using an ImageStream the Operator will watch for any updates and will re-deploy the modified image.\n\n#### Custom RBAC\nThis Operator is capable of using a custom ServiceAccount from the caller, allowing it to follow RBAC restrictions. By default it creates a ServiceAccount if one is not specified, which can also be bound with specific roles.\n\n#### Environment Configuration\nYou can configure a variety of artifacts with your deployment, such as: labels, annotations, and environment variables from a ConfigMap, a Secret or a value.\n\n#### Routing\nExpose your application to external users via a single toggle to create a Route on OpenShift or an Ingress on other Kubernetes environments. Advanced configuration, such as TLS settings, are also easily enabled.  Expiring Route certificates are re-issued.\n\n#### High Availability via Horizontal Pod Autoscaling\nRun multiple instances of your application for high availability. Either specify a static number of replicas or easily configure horizontal auto scaling to create (and delete) instances based on resource consumption.\n\n#### Persistence and advanced storage\nEnable persistence for your application by specifying simple requirements: just tell us the size of the storage and where you would like it to be mounted and We will create and manage that storage for you.\nThis toggles a StatefulSet resource instead of a Deployment resource, so your container can recover transactions and state upon a pod restart.\nWe offer an advanced mode where the user specifies a built-in PersistentVolumeClaim, allowing them to configure many details of the persistent volume, such as its storage class and access mode.\n\n#### Service Binding\nEasily bind to available services in your cluster.  Your runtime components can expose and consume other services by simply specifying the target endpoinds: we take care of the heavy lifting such as creating k8s Secrets, injecting them into your container and watching for any changes in configuration!  This way your applications can dynamically reconnect to its required services without any intervention or interruption.\n\n#### Exposing metrics to Prometheus\nThe Runtime Component Operator exposes the runtime container's metrics via the [Prometheus Operator](https://operatorhub.io/operator/prometheus).\nUsers can pick between a basic mode, where they simply specify the label that Prometheus is watching to scrape the metrics from the container, or they can specify the full `ServiceMonitor` spec embedded into the RuntimeComponent's `spec.monitoring` key controlling things like the poll internal and security credentials.\n\n#### Easily mount logs and transaction directories\nIf you need to mount the logs and transaction data from your runtime component to an external volume such as NFS (or any storage supported in your cluster), simply add the following (customizing the folder location and size) to your RuntimeComponent CR:\n``` storage: size: 2Gi mountPath: \"/logs\" ```\n\n#### Integration with OpenShift Serverless\nDeploy your serverless runtime component using a single toggle.  The Operator will convert all of its generated resources into [Knative](https://knative.dev) resources, allowing your pod to automatically scale to 0 when it is idle.\n\n#### Integration with OpenShift's Topology UI\nWe set the corresponding labels to support OpenShift's Developer Topology UI, which allows you to visualize your entire set of deployments and how they are connected.\n\nSee our [**documentation**](https://github.com/application-stacks/runtime-component-operator/tree/main/doc/) for more information.\n",

It enables enterprise architects to govern the way their applications get deployed & managed in the cluster, while dramatically reducing the learning curve for developers to deploy into Kubernetes - allowing them to focus on writing the code!\nHere are some key features:\n\n#### Application Lifecyle\nYou can deploy your runtime component container by either pointing to a container image, or an OpenShift ImageStream. When using an ImageStream the Operator will watch for any updates and will re-deploy the modified image.\n\n#### Custom RBAC\nThis Operator is capable of using a custom ServiceAccount from the caller, allowing it to follow RBAC restrictions. By default it creates a ServiceAccount if one is not specified, which can also be bound with specific roles.\n\n#### Environment Configuration\nYou can configure a variety of artifacts with your deployment, such as: labels, annotations, and environment variables from a ConfigMap, a Secret or a value.\n\n#### Routing\nExpose your application to external users via a single toggle to create a Route on OpenShift or an Ingress on other Kubernetes environments. Advanced configuration, such as TLS settings, are also easily enabled.  Expiring Route certificates are re-issued.\n\n#### High Availability via Horizontal Pod Autoscaling\nRun multiple instances of your application for high availability. Either specify a static number of replicas or easily configure horizontal auto scaling to create (and delete) instances based on resource consumption.\n\n#### Persistence and advanced storage\nEnable persistence for your application by specifying simple requirements: just tell us the size of the storage and where you would like it to be mounted and We will create and manage that storage for you.\nThis toggles a StatefulSet resource instead of a Deployment resource, so your container can recover transactions and state upon a pod restart.\nWe offer an advanced mode where the user specifies a built-in PersistentVolumeClaim, allowing them to configure many details of the persistent volume, such as its storage class and access mode.\n\n#### Service Binding\nEasily bind to available services in your cluster.  Your runtime components can expose and consume other services by simply specifying the target endpoinds: we take care of the heavy lifting such as creating k8s Secrets, injecting them into your container and watching for any changes in configuration!  This way your applications can dynamically reconnect to its required services without any intervention or interruption.\n\n#### Exposing metrics to Prometheus\nThe Runtime Component Operator exposes the runtime container's metrics via the [Prometheus Operator](https://operatorhub.io/operator/prometheus).\nUsers can pick between a basic mode, where they simply specify the label that Prometheus is watching to scrape the metrics from the container, or they can specify the full `ServiceMonitor` spec embedded into the RuntimeComponent's `spec.monitoring` key controlling things like the poll internal and security credentials.\n\n#### Easily mount logs and transaction directories\nIf you need to mount the logs and transaction data from your runtime component to an external volume such as NFS (or any storage supported in your cluster), simply add the following (customizing the folder location and size) to your RuntimeComponent CR:\n``` storage: size: 2Gi mountPath: \"/logs\" ```\n\n#### Integration with OpenShift Serverless\nDeploy your serverless runtime component using a single toggle.  The Operator will convert all of its generated resources into [Knative](https://knative.dev) resources, allowing your pod to automatically scale to 0 when it is idle.\n\n#### Integration with OpenShift's Topology UI\nWe set the corresponding labels to support OpenShift's Developer Topology UI, which allows you to visualize your entire set of deployments and how they are connected.\n\nSee our [**documentation**](https://github.com/application-stacks/runtime-component-operator/tree/main/doc/) for more information.\n",

      "csv_description": "Federator.ai helps enterprises optimize cloud resources, maximize application performance, and save significant cost without excessive over-provisioning or under-provisioning of resources, meeting the service-level requirements of their applications.\n\nEnterprises often lack understanding of the resources needed to support their applications. This leads to either excessive over-provisioning or under-provisioning of resources (CPU, memory, storage). Using machine learning, Federator.ai determines the optimal cloud resources needed to support any workload on OpenShift and helps users find the best-cost instances from cloud providers for their applications.\n\n\n**Multi-layer workload prediction**\n\nUsing machine learning and math-based algorithms, Federator.ai predicts containerized application and cluster node resource usage as the basis for resource recommendations at application level as well as at cluster node level. Federator.ai supports prediction for both physical/virtual CPUs and memories.\n\n\n**Auto-scaling via resource recommendation**\n\nFederator.ai utilizes the predicted resource usage to recommend the right number and size of pods for applications. Integrated with Datadog's WPA, applications are automatically scaled to meet the predicted resource usage.\n\n\n**Application-aware recommendation execution**\n\nOptimizing the resource usage and performance goals, Federator.ai uses application specific metrics for workload prediction and pod capacity estimation to auto-scale the right number of pods for best performance without overprovisioning.\n\n\n**Multi-cloud Cost Analysis**\n\nWith resource usage prediction, Federator.ai analyzes potential cost of a cluster on different public cloud providers. It also recommend appropriate cluster nodes and instance types based on resource usage.\n\n\n**Custom Datadog/Sysdig Dashboards**\n\nPredefined custom Datadog/Sysdig Dashboards for workload prediction/recommendation visualization for cluster nodes and applications.\n\n\n**Additional resources**\n\nWant more product information?

      "csv_description": "Federator.ai helps enterprises optimize cloud resources, maximize application performance, and save significant cost without excessive over-provisioning or under-provisioning of resources, meeting the service-level requirements of their applications.\n\nEnterprises often lack understanding of the resources needed to support their applications. This leads to either excessive over-provisioning or under-provisioning of resources (CPU, memory, storage). Using machine learning, Federator.ai determines the optimal cloud resources needed to support any workload on OpenShift and helps users find the best-cost instances from cloud providers for their applications.\n\n\n**Multi-layer workload prediction**\n\nUsing machine learning and math-based algorithms, Federator.ai predicts containerized application and cluster node resource usage as the basis for resource recommendations at application level as well as at cluster node level. Federator.ai supports prediction for both physical/virtual CPUs and memories.\n\n\n**Auto-scaling via resource recommendation**\n\nFederator.ai utilizes the predicted resource usage to recommend the right number and size of pods for applications. Integrated with Datadog's WPA, applications are automatically scaled to meet the predicted resource usage.\n\n\n**Application-aware recommendation execution**\n\nOptimizing the resource usage and performance goals, Federator.ai uses application specific metrics for workload prediction and pod capacity estimation to auto-scale the right number of pods for best performance without overprovisioning.\n\n\n**Multi-cloud Cost Analysis**\n\nWith resource usage prediction, Federator.ai analyzes potential cost of a cluster on different public cloud providers. It also recommend appropriate cluster nodes and instance types based on resource usage.\n\n\n**Custom Datadog/Sysdig Dashboards**\n\nPredefined custom Datadog/Sysdig Dashboards for workload prediction/recommendation visualization for cluster nodes and applications.\n\n\n**Additional resources**\n\nWant more product information?

      "csv_description": "Federator.ai helps enterprises optimize cloud resources, maximize application performance, and save significant cost without excessive over-provisioning or under-provisioning of resources, meeting the service-level requirements of their applications.\n\nEnterprises often lack understanding of the resources needed to support their applications. This leads to either excessive over-provisioning or under-provisioning of resources (CPU, memory, storage). Using machine learning, Federator.ai determines the optimal cloud resources needed to support any workload on OpenShift and helps users find the best-cost instances from cloud providers for their applications.\n\n\n**Multi-layer workload prediction**\n\nUsing machine learning and math-based algorithms, Federator.ai predicts containerized application and cluster node resource usage as the basis for resource recommendations at application level as well as at cluster node level. Federator.ai supports prediction for both physical/virtual CPUs and memories.\n\n\n**Auto-scaling via resource recommendation**\n\nFederator.ai utilizes the predicted resource usage to recommend the right number and size of pods for applications. Integrated with Datadog's WPA, applications are automatically scaled to meet the predicted resource usage.\n\n\n**Application-aware recommendation execution**\n\nOptimizing the resource usage and performance goals, Federator.ai uses application specific metrics for workload prediction and pod capacity estimation to auto-scale the right number of pods for best performance without overprovisioning.\n\n\n**Multi-cloud Cost Analysis**\n\nWith resource usage prediction, Federator.ai analyzes potential cost of a cluster on different public cloud providers. It also recommend appropriate cluster nodes and instance types based on resource usage.\n\n\n**Custom Datadog/Sysdig Dashboards**\n\nPredefined custom Datadog/Sysdig Dashboards for workload prediction/recommendation visualization for cluster nodes and applications.\n\n\n**Additional resources**\n\nWant more product information?

      "csv_description": "This advanced Operator is capable of deploying any runtime component image with consistent, production-grade QoS. It enables enterprise architects to govern the way their applications get deployed & managed in the cluster, while dramatically reducing the learning curve for developers to deploy into Kubernetes - allowing them to focus on writing the code!\nHere are some key features:\n\n#### Application Lifecyle\nYou can deploy your runtime component container by either pointing to a container image, or an OpenShift ImageStream. When using an ImageStream the Operator will watch for any updates and will re-deploy the modified image.\n\n#### Custom RBAC\nThis Operator is capable of using a custom ServiceAccount from the caller, allowing it to follow RBAC restrictions. By default it creates a ServiceAccount if one is not specified, which can also be bound with specific roles.\n\n#### Environment Configuration\nYou can configure a variety of artifacts with your deployment, such as: labels, annotations, and environment variables from a ConfigMap, a Secret or a value.\n\n#### Routing\nExpose your application to external users via a single toggle to create a Route on OpenShift or an Ingress on other Kubernetes environments. Advanced configuration, such as TLS settings, are also easily enabled.  Expiring Route certificates are re-issued.\n\n#### High Availability via Horizontal Pod Autoscaling\nRun multiple instances of your application for high availability. Either specify a static number of replicas or easily configure horizontal auto scaling to create (and delete) instances based on resource consumption.\n\n#### Persistence and advanced storage\nEnable persistence for your application by specifying simple requirements: just tell us the size of the storage and where you would like it to be mounted and We will create and manage that storage for you.\nThis toggles a StatefulSet resource instead of a Deployment resource, so your container can recover transactions and state upon a pod restart.\nWe offer an advanced mode where the user specifies a built-in PersistentVolumeClaim, allowing them to configure many details of the persistent volume, such as its storage class and access mode.\n\n#### Service Binding\nEasily bind to available services in your cluster.  Your runtime components can expose and consume other services by simply specifying the target endpoinds: we take care of the heavy lifting such as creating k8s Secrets, injecting them into your container and watching for any changes in configuration!  This way your applications can dynamically reconnect to its required services without any intervention or interruption.\n\n#### Exposing metrics to Prometheus\nThe Runtime Component Operator exposes the runtime container's metrics via the [Prometheus Operator](https://operatorhub.io/operator/prometheus).\nUsers can pick between a basic mode, where they simply specify the label that Prometheus is watching to scrape the metrics from the container, or they can specify the full `ServiceMonitor` spec embedded into the RuntimeComponent's `spec.monitoring` key controlling things like the poll internal and security credentials.\n\n#### Easily mount logs and transaction directories\nIf you need to mount the logs and transaction data from your runtime component to an external volume such as NFS (or any storage supported in your cluster), simply add the following (customizing the folder location and size) to your RuntimeComponent CR:\n``` storage: size: 2Gi mountPath: \"/logs\" ```\n\n#### Integration with OpenShift Serverless\nDeploy your serverless runtime component using a single toggle.  The Operator will convert all of its generated resources into [Knative](https://knative.dev) resources, allowing your pod to automatically scale to 0 when it is idle.\n\n#### Integration with OpenShift's Topology UI\nWe set the corresponding labels to support OpenShift's Developer Topology UI, which allows you to visualize your entire set of deployments and how they are connected.\n\nSee our [**documentation**](https://github.com/application-stacks/runtime-component-operator/tree/main/doc/) for more information.\n",

      "csv_description": "Federator.ai helps enterprises optimize cloud resources, maximize application performance, and save significant cost without excessive over-provisioning or under-provisioning of resources, meeting the service-level requirements of their applications.\n\nEnterprises often lack understanding of the resources needed to support their applications. This leads to either excessive over-provisioning or under-provisioning of resources (CPU, memory, storage). Using machine learning, Federator.ai determines the optimal cloud resources needed to support any workload on OpenShift and helps users find the best-cost instances from cloud providers for their applications.\n\n\n**Multi-layer workload prediction**\n\nUsing machine learning and math-based algorithms, Federator.ai predicts containerized application and cluster node resource usage as the basis for resource recommendations at application level as well as at cluster node level. Federator.ai supports prediction for both physical/virtual CPUs and memories.\n\n\n**Auto-scaling via resource recommendation**\n\nFederator.ai utilizes the predicted resource usage to recommend the right number and size of pods for applications. Integrated with Datadog's WPA, applications are automatically scaled to meet the predicted resource usage.\n\n\n**Application-aware recommendation execution**\n\nOptimizing the resource usage and performance goals, Federator.ai uses application specific metrics for workload prediction and pod capacity estimation to auto-scale the right number of pods for best performance without overprovisioning.\n\n\n**Multi-cloud Cost Analysis**\n\nWith resource usage prediction, Federator.ai analyzes potential cost of a cluster on different public cloud providers. It also recommend appropriate cluster nodes and instance types based on resource usage.\n\n\n**Custom Datadog/Sysdig Dashboards**\n\nPredefined custom Datadog/Sysdig Dashboards for workload prediction/recommendation visualization for cluster nodes and applications.\n\n\n**Additional resources**\n\nWant more product information?
