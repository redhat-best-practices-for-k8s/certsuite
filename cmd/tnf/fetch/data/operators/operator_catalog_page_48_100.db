      "csv_description": "This advanced Operator is capable of deploying any runtime component image with consistent, production-grade QoS. It enables enterprise architects to govern the way their applications get deployed & managed in the cluster, while dramatically reducing the learning curve for developers to deploy into Kubernetes - allowing them to focus on writing the code!\nHere are some key features:\n\n#### Application Lifecyle\nYou can deploy your runtime component container by either pointing to a container image, or an OpenShift ImageStream. When using an ImageStream the Operator will watch for any updates and will re-deploy the modified image.\n\n#### Custom RBAC\nThis Operator is capable of using a custom ServiceAccount from the caller, allowing it to follow RBAC restrictions. By default it creates a ServiceAccount if one is not specified, which can also be bound with specific roles.\n\n#### Environment Configuration\nYou can configure a variety of artifacts with your deployment, such as: labels, annotations, and environment variables from a ConfigMap, a Secret or a value.\n\n#### Routing\nExpose your application to external users via a single toggle to create a Route on OpenShift or an Ingress on other Kubernetes environments. Advanced configuration, such as TLS settings, are also easily enabled.  Expiring Route certificates are re-issued.\n\n#### High Availability via Horizontal Pod Autoscaling\nRun multiple instances of your application for high availability. Either specify a static number of replicas or easily configure horizontal auto scaling to create (and delete) instances based on resource consumption.\n\n#### Persistence and advanced storage\nEnable persistence for your application by specifying simple requirements: just tell us the size of the storage and where you would like it to be mounted and We will create and manage that storage for you.\nThis toggles a StatefulSet resource instead of a Deployment resource, so your container can recover transactions and state upon a pod restart.\nWe offer an advanced mode where the user specifies a built-in PersistentVolumeClaim, allowing them to configure many details of the persistent volume, such as its storage class and access mode.\n\n#### Service Binding\nEasily bind to available services in your cluster.  Your runtime components can expose and consume other services by simply specifying the target endpoinds: we take care of the heavy lifting such as creating k8s Secrets, injecting them into your container and watching for any changes in configuration!  This way your applications can dynamically reconnect to its required services without any intervention or interruption.\n\n#### Exposing metrics to Prometheus\nThe Runtime Component Operator exposes the runtime container's metrics via the [Prometheus Operator](https://operatorhub.io/operator/prometheus).\nUsers can pick between a basic mode, where they simply specify the label that Prometheus is watching to scrape the metrics from the container, or they can specify the full `ServiceMonitor` spec embedded into the RuntimeComponent's `spec.monitoring` key controlling things like the poll internal and security credentials.\n\n#### Easily mount logs and transaction directories\nIf you need to mount the logs and transaction data from your runtime component to an external volume such as NFS (or any storage supported in your cluster), simply add the following (customizing the folder location and size) to your RuntimeComponent CR:\n``` storage: size: 2Gi mountPath: \"/logs\" ```\n\n#### Integration with OpenShift Serverless\nDeploy your serverless runtime component using a single toggle.  The Operator will convert all of its generated resources into [Knative](https://knative.dev) resources, allowing your pod to automatically scale to 0 when it is idle.\n\n#### Integration with OpenShift's Topology UI\nWe set the corresponding labels to support OpenShift's Developer Topology UI, which allows you to visualize your entire set of deployments and how they are connected.\n\nSee our [**documentation**](https://github.com/application-stacks/runtime-component-operator/tree/main/doc/) for more information.\n",

The Operator gives users the ability to provision\n> Atlas projects, clusters and database users using Kubernetes Specifications and bind connection information\n> into applications deployed to Kubernetes.\n\n## Quick Start guide\n### Step 1. Deploy Kubernetes operator by clicking Install button.\n\n### Step 2. Create Atlas Cluster\n\n**1.** Create an Atlas API Key Secret\nIn order to work with the Atlas Operator you need to provide [authentication information](https://docs.atlas.mongodb.com/configure-api-access)\n to allow the Atlas Operator to communicate with Atlas API. Once you have generated a Public and Private key in Atlas, you can create a Kuberentes Secret with:\n```\nkubectl create secret generic mongodb-atlas-operator-api-key \\\n         --from-literal=\"orgId=<the_atlas_organization_id>\" \\\n         --from-literal=\"publicApiKey=<the_atlas_api_public_key>\" \\\n         --from-literal=\"privateApiKey=<the_atlas_api_private_key>\" \\\n         -n openshift-operators\n```\n(Note, that you should use the namespace where the Operator was installed - it's `openshift-operators` by default)\n\n**2.** Create an `AtlasProject` Custom Resource\n\nThe `AtlasProject` CustomResource represents Atlas Projects in our Kubernetes cluster. You need to specify\n`projectIpAccessList` with the IP addresses or CIDR blocks of any hosts that will connect to the Atlas Cluster.\n```\napiVersion: atlas.mongodb.com/v1\nkind: AtlasProject\nmetadata:\n  name: my-project\nspec:\n  name: Test Atlas Operator Project\n  projectIpAccessList:\n    - ipAddress: \"192.0.2.15\"\n      comment: \"IP address for Application Server A\"\n    - ipAddress: \"203.0.113.0/24\"\n      comment: \"CIDR block for Application Server B - D\"\n```\n**3.** Create an `AtlasDeployment` Custom Resource.\nThe example below is a minimal configuration to create an M10 Atlas cluster in the AWS US East region. For a full list of properties, check\n`atlasclusters.atlas.mongodb.com` [CRD specification](config/crd/bases/atlas.mongodb.com_atlasclusters.yaml)):\n```\napiVersion: atlas.mongodb.com/v1\nkind: AtlasDeployment\nmetadata:\n  name: my-atlas-cluster\nspec:\n  name: \"Test-cluster\"\n  projectRef:\n    name: my-project\n  providerSettings:\n    instanceSizeName: M10\n    providerName: AWS\n    regionName: US_EAST_1\n```\n\n**4.** Create a database user password Kubernetes Secret\nThe Secret must be created in the same namespace as the `AtlasDeployment` and `AtlasProject` were created.\n```\nkubectl create secret generic the-user-password --from-literal=\"password=P@@sword%\"\n```\n\n**5.** Create an `AtlasDatabaseUser` Custom Resource\n\nIn order to connect to an Atlas Cluster the database user needs to be created. `AtlasDatabaseUser` resource should reference\nthe password Kubernetes Secret created in the previous step.\n```\napiVersion: atlas.mongodb.com/v1\nkind: AtlasDatabaseUser\nmetadata:\n  name: my-database-user\nspec:\n  roles:\n    - roleName: \"readWriteAnyDatabase\"\n      databaseName: \"admin\"\n  projectRef:\n    name: my-project\n  username: theuser\n  passwordSecretRef:\n    name: the-user-password\n```\n**6.** Wait for the `AtlasDatabaseUser` Custom Resource to be ready\n\nWait until the AtlasDatabaseUser resource gets to \"ready\" status (it will wait until the cluster is created that may take around 10 minutes):\n```\nkubectl get atlasdatabaseusers my-database-user -o=jsonpath='{.status.conditions[?(@.type==\"Ready\")].status}'\nTrue\n```\n### Step 3. Connect your application to the Atlas Cluster\n\nThe Atlas Operator will create a Kubernetes Secret with the information necessary to connect to the Atlas Cluster created\nin the previous step. An application in the same Kubernetes Cluster can mount and use the Secret:\n\n```\n...\ncontainers:\n      - name: test-app\n        env:\n         - name: \"CONNECTION_STRING\"\n           valueFrom:\n             secretKeyRef:\n               name: test-atlas-operator-project-test-cluster-theuser\n               key: connectionStringStandardSrv\n\n```\n",

Pachyderm provides industry leading data versioning, pipelines and lineage that allow data science teams to automate the machine learning lifecycle and optimize their machine learning operations (MLOps). \n\n## Getting started\n\n1. Pachyderm uses an object store to store your data. Set the pachd storage backend at `pachyderm.spec.pachd.storage.backend` to `AMAZON`, `MICROSOFT`, `GOOGLE` or `MINIO` depending on your storage provider. Additionally, create a user with read/write access to the object store.\n\n2. Setup the user credentials in the section, `pachyderm.spec.pachd.storage`. Required fields depend on the backend type set in step 1 above.\n\n3. Finally, deploy the pachyderm cluster in its own namespace.\n\nFor more information on getting started, reference the documentation.\n",

      "csv_description": "## Entando\n\nThe Entando platform accelerates the development and lifecycle  management of fully modularized applications on Kubernetes. It  provides tools to help developers create and manage applications  using modular frontend and backend components.\nThe Entando Operator automates the installation, provisioning, and  configuration management of the components that make up an Entando  application. Specifically, the operator manages the following custom  resources:\n**EntandoKeycloakServers** for centralized authentication of frontend  and backend components. The operator can deploy Keycloak, or in certified  environments, Red Hat SSO servers that can then be used by subsequent  deployments as an OpenID Connect provider.\n**EntandoApps** for hosting an Entando application. EntandoApps are hosted on Wildfly or JBoss EAP containers, and can also be used to deploy custom  EntandoApp containers.\n**EntandoPlugins** for deploying microservices to customize or enhance your EntandoApp. Entando microservice plugins are deployed to your cluster, and  then linked to one or more EntandoApps.\n## Using the Operator\nThe Entando Operator can be deployed using the default settings without any  configuration. Once deployed, the operator can be customized by editing  the *configmap* and secrets.\n### ConfigMap: entando-operator-config\nThe 'entando-operator-config' ConfigMap can be added after deployment and any changes to it will be picked up by the operator on subsequent event processing. It supports the following keys:\n\n    entando.k8s.operator.gc.controller.pods: set this to \"false\" to keep controller pods after completion.\n    entando.k8s.operator.compliance.mode: set this to \"community\" if there is no requirement for Red Hat compliance.\n    entando.k8s.operator.image.pull.secrets: a comma separated list containing the names of pull secrets that will be linked to all service accounts.\n    entando.k8s.operator.disable.pvc.garbage.collection: set this to \"false\" if you want Persistent Volume Claims to be deleted with the custom resources they are associated with.\n    entando.k8s.operator.impose.default.limits: set this to \"false\" if there is no need to limit the resource consumption of pods on your cluster.\n    entando.k8s.operator.request.to.limit.ratio: a decimal number that default limits will be multiplied by to calculate default requests for resources.\n    entando.k8s.operator.force.db.password.reset: set this to \"true\" if you plan to delete Secrets from your namespace but you want to retain the Database they point to.\n    entando.k8s.operator.pull.policy.override: specify your preferred pullPolicy for images. The default is Always.\n    entando.tls.secret.name: The name of a standard TLS secret to use for HTTPS Ingresses. See the section entando-tls-secret.\n    entando.ca.secret.name: The name of a secret containing CA certificates. See the section entando-ca-cert-secret.\n    entando.assume.external.https.provider: Set this to \"true\" if your cloud provider handles HTTPS for you.\n    entando.use.auto.cert.generation: Set this to \"true\" to have Openshift use its internal CA to generate certificates for your Routes.\n    entando.default.routing.suffix: The domain name that can be suffixed to deployment names when the ingressHostName is omitted. Needs to be preconfigured on your DNS provider.\n    entando.pod.completion.timeout.seconds: The time it will take before Entando fails a run-to-completion Pod.\n    entando.pod.readiness.timeout.seconds: The time it will take before Entando fails a Service Pod.\n    entando.pod.shutdown.timeout.seconds: The time Entando will give a Pod to shutdown gracefully.\n\n\n### entando-pull-secret\nThe secret to be used to pull Entando images from the Red Hat container registry. The name of this secret is hard coded as it is required for the ClusterServiceVersion of this Operator\n### entando-tls-secret\nA standard Kubernetes TLS secret that will be used on all deployments where no custom TLS secret name is specified.\n### entando-ca-cert-secret\nThis is an opaque secret in the Entando Operator's namespace that contains the certificates of all trusted certificate authorities in your environment. This is generally used mainly for self signed certificates. As is generally the case for opaque secrets, there are no constraints on the keys in this secret. However, limit the files inside the secret to X509 certificates or certificate chains. The Entando Operator will load all of these files into a Java keystore that it then configures as the trust store for each container that uses Java.\n",

      "csv_description": "## Entando\n\nThe Entando platform accelerates the development and lifecycle  management of fully modularized applications on Kubernetes. It  provides tools to help developers create and manage applications  using modular frontend and backend components.\nThe Entando Operator automates the installation, provisioning, and  configuration management of the components that make up an Entando  application. Specifically, the operator manages the following custom  resources:\n**EntandoKeycloakServers** for centralized authentication of frontend  and backend components. The operator can deploy Keycloak, or in certified  environments, Red Hat SSO servers that can then be used by subsequent  deployments as an OpenID Connect provider.\n**EntandoApps** for hosting an Entando application. EntandoApps are hosted on Wildfly or JBoss EAP containers, and can also be used to deploy custom  EntandoApp containers.\n**EntandoPlugins** for deploying microservices to customize or enhance your EntandoApp. Entando microservice plugins are deployed to your cluster, and  then linked to one or more EntandoApps.\n## Using the Operator\nThe Entando Operator can be deployed using the default settings without any  configuration. Once deployed, the operator can be customized by editing  the *configmap* and secrets.\n### ConfigMap: entando-operator-config\nThe 'entando-operator-config' ConfigMap can be added after deployment and any changes to it will be picked up by the operator on subsequent event processing. It supports the following keys:\n\n    entando.k8s.operator.gc.controller.pods: set this to \"false\" to keep controller pods after completion.\n    entando.k8s.operator.compliance.mode: set this to \"community\" if there is no requirement for Red Hat compliance.\n    entando.k8s.operator.image.pull.secrets: a comma separated list containing the names of pull secrets that will be linked to all service accounts.\n    entando.k8s.operator.disable.pvc.garbage.collection: set this to \"false\" if you want Persistent Volume Claims to be deleted with the custom resources they are associated with.\n    entando.k8s.operator.impose.default.limits: set this to \"false\" if there is no need to limit the resource consumption of pods on your cluster.\n    entando.k8s.operator.request.to.limit.ratio: a decimal number that default limits will be multiplied by to calculate default requests for resources.\n    entando.k8s.operator.force.db.password.reset: set this to \"true\" if you plan to delete Secrets from your namespace but you want to retain the Database they point to.\n    entando.k8s.operator.pull.policy.override: specify your preferred pullPolicy for images. The default is Always.\n    entando.tls.secret.name: The name of a standard TLS secret to use for HTTPS Ingresses. See the section entando-tls-secret.\n    entando.ca.secret.name: The name of a secret containing CA certificates. See the section entando-ca-cert-secret.\n    entando.assume.external.https.provider: Set this to \"true\" if your cloud provider handles HTTPS for you.\n    entando.use.auto.cert.generation: Set this to \"true\" to have Openshift use its internal CA to generate certificates for your Routes.\n    entando.default.routing.suffix: The domain name that can be suffixed to deployment names when the ingressHostName is omitted. Needs to be preconfigured on your DNS provider.\n    entando.pod.completion.timeout.seconds: The time it will take before Entando fails a run-to-completion Pod.\n    entando.pod.readiness.timeout.seconds: The time it will take before Entando fails a Service Pod.\n    entando.pod.shutdown.timeout.seconds: The time Entando will give a Pod to shutdown gracefully.\n\n\n### entando-pull-secret\nThe secret to be used to pull Entando images from the Red Hat container registry. The name of this secret is hard coded as it is required for the ClusterServiceVersion of this Operator\n### entando-tls-secret\nA standard Kubernetes TLS secret that will be used on all deployments where no custom TLS secret name is specified.\n### entando-ca-cert-secret\nThis is an opaque secret in the Entando Operator's namespace that contains the certificates of all trusted certificate authorities in your environment. This is generally used mainly for self signed certificates. As is generally the case for opaque secrets, there are no constraints on the keys in this secret. However, limit the files inside the secret to X509 certificates or certificate chains. The Entando Operator will load all of these files into a Java keystore that it then configures as the trust store for each container that uses Java.\n",

It  provides tools to help developers create and manage applications  using modular frontend and backend components.\nThe Entando Operator automates the installation, provisioning, and  configuration management of the components that make up an Entando  application. Specifically, the operator manages the following custom  resources:\n**EntandoKeycloakServers** for centralized authentication of frontend  and backend components. The operator can deploy Keycloak, or in certified  environments, Red Hat SSO servers that can then be used by subsequent  deployments as an OpenID Connect provider.\n**EntandoApps** for hosting an Entando application. EntandoApps are hosted on Wildfly or JBoss EAP containers, and can also be used to deploy custom  EntandoApp containers.\n**EntandoPlugins** for deploying microservices to customize or enhance your EntandoApp. Entando microservice plugins are deployed to your cluster, and  then linked to one or more EntandoApps.\n## Using the Operator\nThe Entando Operator can be deployed using the default settings without any  configuration. Once deployed, the operator can be customized by editing  the *configmap* and secrets.\n### ConfigMap: entando-operator-config\nThe 'entando-operator-config' ConfigMap can be added after deployment and any changes to it will be picked up by the operator on subsequent event processing. It supports the following keys:\n\n    entando.k8s.operator.gc.controller.pods: set this to \"false\" to keep controller pods after completion.\n    entando.k8s.operator.compliance.mode: set this to \"community\" if there is no requirement for Red Hat compliance.\n    entando.k8s.operator.image.pull.secrets: a comma separated list containing the names of pull secrets that will be linked to all service accounts.\n    entando.k8s.operator.disable.pvc.garbage.collection: set this to \"false\" if you want Persistent Volume Claims to be deleted with the custom resources they are associated with.\n    entando.k8s.operator.impose.default.limits: set this to \"false\" if there is no need to limit the resource consumption of pods on your cluster.\n    entando.k8s.operator.request.to.limit.ratio: a decimal number that default limits will be multiplied by to calculate default requests for resources.\n    entando.k8s.operator.force.db.password.reset: set this to \"true\" if you plan to delete Secrets from your namespace but you want to retain the Database they point to.\n    entando.k8s.operator.pull.policy.override: specify your preferred pullPolicy for images. The default is Always.\n    entando.tls.secret.name: The name of a standard TLS secret to use for HTTPS Ingresses. See the section entando-tls-secret.\n    entando.ca.secret.name: The name of a secret containing CA certificates. See the section entando-ca-cert-secret.\n    entando.assume.external.https.provider: Set this to \"true\" if your cloud provider handles HTTPS for you.\n    entando.use.auto.cert.generation: Set this to \"true\" to have Openshift use its internal CA to generate certificates for your Routes.\n    entando.default.routing.suffix: The domain name that can be suffixed to deployment names when the ingressHostName is omitted. Needs to be preconfigured on your DNS provider.\n    entando.pod.completion.timeout.seconds: The time it will take before Entando fails a run-to-completion Pod.\n    entando.pod.readiness.timeout.seconds: The time it will take before Entando fails a Service Pod.\n    entando.pod.shutdown.timeout.seconds: The time Entando will give a Pod to shutdown gracefully.\n\n\n### entando-pull-secret\nThe secret to be used to pull Entando images from the Red Hat container registry. The name of this secret is hard coded as it is required for the ClusterServiceVersion of this Operator\n### entando-tls-secret\nA standard Kubernetes TLS secret that will be used on all deployments where no custom TLS secret name is specified.\n### entando-ca-cert-secret\nThis is an opaque secret in the Entando Operator's namespace that contains the certificates of all trusted certificate authorities in your environment. This is generally used mainly for self signed certificates. As is generally the case for opaque secrets, there are no constraints on the keys in this secret. However, limit the files inside the secret to X509 certificates or certificate chains. The Entando Operator will load all of these files into a Java keystore that it then configures as the trust store for each container that uses Java.\n",

In particular the configuration can be defined externally in one or more locations, and changes to this configuration may require all instances to be reloaded for the changes to take effect. \n\nThe internal Kubernetes deployment controller does not have any knowledge of how an IBM Application Gateway instance should behave when the configuration changes. As such this IBM Application Gateway specific Kubernetes operator is available to be deployed. Once deployed the operator can manage the lifecycle of the IBM Application Gateway instances.\n\nSee the project [Readme](https://github.com/IBM-Security/ibm-application-gateway-operator/blob/master/README.md) for further information and details.\n\n",

      "csv_description": "The Dynatrace Operator supports rollout and lifecycle of various Dynatrace components in Kubernetes and OpenShift.\n\nAs of launch, the Dynatrace Operator can be used to deploy a containerized ActiveGate for Kubernetes API monitoring. New capabilities will be added to the Dynatrace Operator over time including metric routing, and API monitoring for AWS, Azure, GCP, and vSphere.\n\nWith v0.2.0 we added the classicFullStack functionality which allows rolling out the OneAgent to your Kubernetes cluster.\nFurthermore, the Dynatrace Operator is now capable of rolling out a containerized ActiveGate for routing the OneAgent traffic.\n\n### Installation\nOnce you've installed the Dynatrace Operator, you can create a DynaKube custom resource.\n\nFirst, please add a Secret within the Project you've deployed the Dynatrace Operator to, which would contain your API and PaaS tokens. Create tokens of type *Dynatrace API* (`API_TOKEN`) and *Platform as a Service* (`PAAS_TOKEN`) and use their values in the following commands respectively.\n\nFor assistance please refer to [Create user-generated access tokens](https://www.dynatrace.com/support/help/shortlink/token#create-user-generated-access-tokens).\n\n``` $ oc -n <project> create secret generic dynakube --from-literal=\"apiToken=API_TOKEN\" --from-literal=\"paasToken=PAAS_TOKEN\" ```\n\nYou may update this Secret at any time to rotate the tokens.\n\nAfter creation of the secret add the DynaKube object in the project where the Dynatrace Operator has been deployed, configured to your needs.\n\n### Required Parameters\n* `apiUrl` - provide the URL to the API of your Dynatrace environment. In Dynatrace SaaS it will look like `https://<ENVIRONMENTID>.live.dynatrace.com/api` . In Dynatrace Managed like `https://<YourDynatraceServerURL>/e/<ENVIRONMENTID>/api` .\n\n### Advanced Options\n* **Disable Certificate Checking** - disable any certificate validation that may interact poorly with proxies with in your cluster\n* **Image Override** - use a copy of the ActiveGate container image from a registry other than Docker's or Red Hat's\n\n#### Kubernetes Monitoring\n* **Kubernetes Monitoring** - when enabled the Dynatrace Operator will create a containerized ActiveGate with the capability to monitor your OpenShift cluster\n* **Replicas** - defines how many replicas of the containerized ActiveGate should be created\n* **NodeSelectors** - select a subset of your cluster's nodes to run the Dynatrace ActiveGate on, based on labels\n* **Environment variables** - define environment variables for the ActiveGate container\n\nFor a complete list of supported parameters please consult the [Operator Deploy Guide](https://www.dynatrace.com/support/help/shortlink/openshift-deploy).\n\n### Help\nYou can find more about our instructions in our [documentation](https://www.dynatrace.com/support/help/shortlink/openshift-deploy#install-dynatrace-operator).\n",

By installing this integration you will be able to deploy Zabbix server / proxies and other components with a single command.\n## Supported Features\n* **Zabbix Server** - Simple Zabbix installation with included Zabbix server, Zabbix web-interface and Zabbix Java Gateway with MySQL database support. The feature does not provide MySQL service and requires an external MySQL database. \n* **Zabbix Server (Full)** - Zabbix installation with included Zabbix server, Zabbix web-interface, Zabbix Java Gateway and MySQL server instance.\n* **Zabbix proxy (SQLite3)** - Very simple way to gain power of Zabbix proxy. The feature has  SQLite3 support for Zabbix proxies and allow to specify amount of proxies. \n* **Zabbix proxy (MySQL)** - Another option of Zabbix proxy. The option support and deliver MySQL database.\n* **Zabbix agent** - Zabbix agent can be deployed on each available node for stability and performance monitoring on remote nodes. It allows to gather metrics with full automation!\n* **Zabbix Appliance** - Zabbix appliance very simple way to test and check Zabbix features. The option provides all core components in one solution. It includes Zabbix server, Zabbix Java Gateway, Zabbix web-interface and MySQL server in deployment. It is very useful for testing Zabbix features!\n## Prerequisites\nAll deployment options are require additional information during deployment. Please, check the following instructions and provide required configuration:\n* **Zabbix Server** - MySQL database host information and MySQL database credentials in specially formatted *Secret*. Additionally it is possible to specify SSL certificates for HTTPS support in *Secret*.\n* **Zabbix Server (Full)** - MySQL database credentials in specially formatted *Secret*. MySQL database volume name information. Additionally it is possible to specify SSL certificates for HTTPS support in *Secret*.\n* **Zabbix proxy (SQLite3)** - Zabbix server host information only.\n* **Zabbix proxy (MySQL)** - MySQL database credentials in specially formatted *Secrets* and Zabbix server host information.\n* **Zabbix agent** - Zabbix server host information only for outgoing and incoming connections. Zabbix agent uses \"privileged\" mode to monitor node resources! For example, running processes.\n* **Zabbix Appliance** - MySQL database credentials in specially formatted *Secret*. MySQL database volume name information. Additionally it is possible to specify SSL certificates for HTTPS support in *Secret*.\n### MySQL credentials\n```\nkind: Secret\napiVersion: v1\nmetadata:\n  name: zabbix-full-secrets\ndata:\n  mysql_root_password: emFiYml4X3N1cGVyX3Jvb3Q= [1]\n  mysql_zabbix_password: emFiYml4X3VzZXJfcGFzc3dvcmQ= [2]\n  mysql_zabbix_username: emFiYml4 [3]\ntype: Opaque\n```\nUsing MySQL root password (*mysqlrootpassword* [1]) Zabbix server / proxy will try to create MySQL database schema with grant permissions to *mysqlzabbixusername* [2] and *mysqlzabbixpassword* [3].\n### SSL certificates for HTTPS\n```\nkind: Secret\napiVersion: v1\nmetadata:\n  name: zabbix-web-sslsecret\ndata:\n  ssl.crt: >-\n   < ssl.crt data>\n  ssl.key: >-\n\t < ssl.key data >\n  dhparam.pem: >-\n   <  dhparam.pem data >\n```\nFiles *ssl.crt*, *ssl.key* and *dhparam.perm* are required for Zabbix web-interface for SSL support.\n",

It allows to gather metrics with full automation!\n* **Zabbix Appliance** - Zabbix appliance very simple way to test and check Zabbix features. The option provides all core components in one solution. It includes Zabbix server, Zabbix Java Gateway, Zabbix web-interface and MySQL server in deployment. It is very useful for testing Zabbix features!\n## Prerequisites\nAll deployment options are require additional information during deployment. Please, check the following instructions and provide required configuration:\n* **Zabbix Server** - MySQL database host information and MySQL database credentials in specially formatted *Secret*. Additionally it is possible to specify SSL certificates for HTTPS support in *Secret*.\n* **Zabbix Server (Full)** - MySQL database credentials in specially formatted *Secret*. MySQL database volume name information. Additionally it is possible to specify SSL certificates for HTTPS support in *Secret*.\n* **Zabbix proxy (SQLite3)** - Zabbix server host information only.\n* **Zabbix proxy (MySQL)** - MySQL database credentials in specially formatted *Secrets* and Zabbix server host information.\n* **Zabbix agent** - Zabbix server host information only for outgoing and incoming connections. Zabbix agent uses \"privileged\" mode to monitor node resources! For example, running processes.\n* **Zabbix Appliance** - MySQL database credentials in specially formatted *Secret*. MySQL database volume name information. Additionally it is possible to specify SSL certificates for HTTPS support in *Secret*.\n### MySQL credentials\n```\nkind: Secret\napiVersion: v1\nmetadata:\n  name: zabbix-full-secrets\ndata:\n  mysql_root_password: emFiYml4X3N1cGVyX3Jvb3Q= [1]\n  mysql_zabbix_password: emFiYml4X3VzZXJfcGFzc3dvcmQ= [2]\n  mysql_zabbix_username: emFiYml4 [3]\ntype: Opaque\n```\nUsing MySQL root password (*mysqlrootpassword* [1]) Zabbix server / proxy will try to create MySQL database schema with grant permissions to *mysqlzabbixusername* [2] and *mysqlzabbixpassword* [3].\n### SSL certificates for HTTPS\n```\nkind: Secret\napiVersion: v1\nmetadata:\n  name: zabbix-web-sslsecret\ndata:\n  ssl.crt: >-\n   < ssl.crt data>\n  ssl.key: >-\n\t < ssl.key data >\n  dhparam.pem: >-\n   <  dhparam.pem data >\n```\nFiles *ssl.crt*, *ssl.key* and *dhparam.perm* are required for Zabbix web-interface for SSL support.\n",

This operator is installed in all namespaces which can support multi-tenant scenarios. **Note:** This operator should only be used by Red Hat partners attempting to certify their operator(s).\n\n\n**Requirements**\n\n\nThe certification operator requires that you have the following tools installed, functional, and in your path.\n- [Install](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.8/cli_reference/openshift_cli/getting-started-cli.html#installing-openshift-cli) oc, the OpenShift CLI tool (tested with version 4.7.13)\n- [Install](https://tekton.dev/docs/cli/) tkn, the Tekton CLI tool (tested with version 0.19.1)\n- [Install](https://git-scm.com/downloads) git, the Git CLI tool (tested with 2.32.0)\n- The certification pipeline expects you to have the source files of your Operator bundle\n\n\n**Pre - Installation**\n\n\nThe below steps exist for simplicity and to make the installation clearer. The operator watches all namespaces, so if secrets/configs/etc already exist in another namespace, feel free to use the existing namespace when following the operator installation steps.\n\n\n**Create a new namespace where the following secrets will be applied.**\n```\noc new-project oco\n```\n\n\n**Add the kubeconfig secret which will be used to deploy the operator under test and run the certification checks.**\n* Open a terminal window\n* Set the `KUBECONFIG` environment variable\n```\nexport KUBECONFIG=/path/to/your/cluster/kubeconfig\n```\n> *This kubeconfig will be used to deploy the Operator under test and run the certification checks.*\n```\noc create secret generic kubeconfig --from-file=kubeconfig=$KUBECONFIG\n```\n\n\n**Configuring steps for submitting the results**\n- Add the github API token to the repo where the PR will be created\n```\noc create secret generic github-api-token --from-literal GITHUB_TOKEN=<github token>\n```\n- Add RedHat Container API access key\n\n  This API access key is specifically related to your unique partner account for Red Hat Connect portal. Instructions to obtain your API key can be found: [here](https://github.com/redhat-openshift-ecosystem/certification-releases/blob/main/4.9/ga/operator-cert-workflow.md#step-b---get-api-key)\n```\noc create secret generic pyxis-api-secret --from-literal pyxis_api_key=< API KEY >\n```\n\n- Optional pipeline configurations can be found [here](https://github.com/redhat-openshift-ecosystem/certification-releases/blob/main/4.9/ga/ci-pipeline.md#optional-configuration)\n\n\n**Execute the Pipeline (Development Iterations)**\n\n\nA pre-requisite to running a pipeline is that a `workspace-template.yaml` exists in the directory you want to execute the `tkn` commands from.\n\nTo create a workspace-template.yaml\n```\ncat <<EOF > workspace-template.yaml\nspec:\n  accessModes:\n    - ReadWriteOnce\n  resources:\n    requests:\n      storage: 5Gi\nEOF\n```\n\nThere are multiple ways to execute the Pipeline which can be found [here](https://github.com/redhat-openshift-ecosystem/certification-releases/blob/main/4.9/ga/ci-pipeline.md#execute-the-pipeline-development-iterations)",

      "csv_description": "\n## Introduction\n\n[vFunction](https://www.vfunction.com/) is a cloud-native modernization platform that combines dynamic and static code analysis, machine learning, and automation to automatically identify and extract services from existing applications. vFunction is the only platform purpose-built for modernization of Java applications.\n\nThe vFunction modernization process starts by learning the running monolithic application, and surfacing the interdependencies within it. Using AI, the platform analyzes and identifies services that can be separated from the application. This decomposition can present a range of micro, mini, or even macro services, depending on your application environment, each being an independently deployable and scalable application component.\n\nvFunction automates the extraction of these services, enabling you to modernize your monolith, quickly and easily.\n\n## The vFunction platform\n\nThe platform consists of 3 basic components; the server, the controller package, and a tools package. The server runs as an operand on an OpenShift environment. The controller package is installed on the machine that runs the monolithic application which can be either a Linux or a Windows machine, and the tools are run on a development machine, with access to the code of the monolithic application.\n\nThe controller package consists of three elements: the vFunction agent, that collects data during the dynamic analysis phase; the vFunction Viper application, that performs static analysis on the binaries of the application; and the vFunction controller that handles all the communication between the agent, Viper, and the vFunction server.\n\nThe vFunction agent is a mix of a Java and native agent, and needs to run on the JVM that is currently running your application. [Refer to the vFunction OOB Support Matrix document](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ccq8LFab1FrYAimDUxwgjiCOdk4QuVzs/view) for a list of supported application servers and JVMs.\n\nThis operator installs a vFunction server instance to be connected later with one or more vFunction controllers installed on your application machine(s).\n\n## Before You Start\n\nThe vFunction operator requires a Red Hat OpenShift Kubernetes Application Platform 4.x.\n\nThe cluster recommended configuration (which is the same as the minimal one) should consist of:\n\n- *1 master node*\n\n- *1 worker node*\n\n- *Storage capacity enough for dynamically provision 2 PVs of 50G each*\n\n- *A default StorageClass configured*\n\nvFunction doesn\u2019t provide any encryption mechanism for data stored on any attached storage. If required, encryption can be achieved by the client by using its own external means on the storage itself.\n\nvFunction supports backup of all critical data as part of the application. Nevertheless, for complete backup of entire data it is recommended that the client apply its own storage based backup mechanism.\n\n## Install Prerequisites\n\n###Cluster:\nThe operator was certified and tested on OCP 4.6 and 4.7.\nIf you encounter any issue with other OCP versions or cloud providers please contact info@vfunction.com.\n\n###Storage:\nThe operator creates two new PersistentVolumeClaims (PVCs) during installation time. For their creation, it relies on the default StorageClass to dynamically provision two PersistentVolumes (PVs). The system must have a default StorageClass in place.\n\nBoth PersistentVolumes are accessed with ReadWriteOnce mode.\n\n###Project:\nThe operator should be installed in a new and dedicated project (namespace). If you intend to install more than one vFunction operands in the same cluster, please use different projects for each one. Installation of more than one operand on the same cluster will allow scaling by load balancing multiple applications to different vFunction servers.\n\n## Installation instructions\n\n1. Prepare the YAML file to use in the installation:\n\n    a. Copy the following YAML template into a text editor:\n\n    ```yaml\n        apiVersion: vfunction.com/v1\n        kind: VfunctionServer\n        metadata:\n          name: vfunction\n          namespace: vfunction\n          labels:\n            name: vfunction\n            app.kubernetes.io/name: vfunction\n            app.kubernetes.io/instance: vfunction-server\n            app.kubernetes.io/managed-by: operator\n        spec:\n          host: \"http://my.domain.com\"\n          org_name: \"MyCompany\"\n          upgrade: \"Daily\"\n          admin:\n            email: \"admin@mycompany.com\"\n            name: \"Admin\"\n            password: \"Password1!\"\n          smtp:\n            password: \"\"\n            url: \"\"\n            identity: \"\"\n            user: \"\"\n          measurements:\n            auto_scaling: \"No\"\n            min_number_of_services: \"2\"\n            max_number_of_services: \"10\"\n          tls:\n            crt: |\n              -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----\n              ...\n              -----END CERTIFICATE-----\n            key: |\n              -----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----\n              ...\n              -----END PRIVATE KEY-----\n    ```\n    b. Customize the template fields by replacing with your information:\n\n    - **host**: Enter the FQDN for accessing the vFunction dashboard.\n                Make sure that you use a domain name and not an IP address. Writing \"https://\" will mandate TLS while writing \"http://\" will expose the server through HTTP.\n    - **org_name**: Enter your organization name.\n    - **upgrade**: Choose auto-upgrade mode\n        - **Daily**: The operator will check for a new version every day at 3 AM and will install it automatically (default).\n        - **Always**: The operator will check for a new version every 10 minutes and will install it automatically.\n        - **Never**: The automatic upgrading mechanism is off.\n        - **Maintenance**: Put the operator in a maintenance mode.\n\n    - **admin.email**: Enter the email address of your administrator.\n    - **admin.name**: Enter the name of your administrator.\n    - **admin.password**: Enter the password you want to use for the vFunction administrator.\n                          The password should be at least 8 characters long, and consist of at least one lowercase letter, at least one uppercase letter, at least one number, and at least one special character.\n    - **smtp.user**: Enter the email address for a designated user for the SMTP server (optional).\n    - **smtp.password**: Enter this user\u2019s password (optional).\n    - **smtp.identity**: Enter this user\u2019s password (optional).\n    - **smtp.url**: Enter the SMTP server URL (optional).\n    - **tls.crt**: If your host FQDN starts with \u201chttps\u201d, paste in the certifications you have for using the TLS connection.\n    - **tls.key**: If your host FQDN starts with \u201chttps\u201d, enter the key you have for using the TLS connection.\n    - **measurements.auto_scaling**: Indicates if the measurement services auto scalling is active.\n    - **measurements.min_num_of_services**: Minimum Number of measurement service pods.\n    - **measurements.max_num_of_services**: Maximum Number of measurement service pods.\n    - **measurements.S3**: Save all measurements data to S3, instead of local PV (optional).\n        - **measurements.S3.bucket**: Measurements S3 bucket name.\n        - **measurements.S3.key**: Measurements S3 key.\n        - **measurements.S3.secret**: Measurements S3 secret.\n        - **measurements.S3.region**: Measurements S3 region.\n    - **backup.mysql.S3**: Backup MySQL to S3 (optional).\n        - **backup.mysql.S3.bucket**: MySQL backup S3 bucket name.\n        - **backup.mysql.S3.key**: MySQL backup S3 key.\n        - **backup.mysql.S3.secret**: MySQL backup S3 secret.\n        - **backup.mysql.S3.region**: MySQL backup S3 region.\n\n1. In the Installed Operators window choose and click on vFunction Operator and then Create Instance.\n1. In the Create vFunctionServer window, paste the YAML file that you created in step 1.\n1. Click Create.\n1. You can now click on your new created vFunction operand in order to see its details and installation progress.\n\n## Verifying the installation\n\nCheck that the operand installed successfully:\n\n1. Check that the \"Operand State\" property shows \u201cWorking\u201d.\n1. Check that the \"Successfully Installed\" property shows \"Yes\".\n\nIf \"Operand State\" shows \"Failed\", it indicates the operand wasn\u2019t installed correctly. Check the events and logs for all pods (operator and image containers) for any issues. In the event that you cannot troubleshoot, contact vFunction support.\n\n## After installation\n\nThe vFunction site is now accessible via the newly created vFunction application custom address, for example, my.domain.com. There are two ways you can access the vFunction dashboard.\n\n### Access using the router canonical hostname\n\n1. Update your DNS provider by creating a canonical name (CNAME) record.\nThis record should point to your host address, and to the \u201dvfunction\u201d subdomain of the  OpenShift canonical router hostname as the alias.\nFor example, ***my.domain.com.   CNAME   vfunction.apps.ocp4.my-openshift.com.***\n2. Find your cluster Router Canonical Hostname address in the newly created vfunction-route-xxx under your vFunction OpenShift project -> **Networking** -> **Routes** -> **vfunction-route-xxx** route -> **Router Canonical Hostname** field.\nYou can now access the dashboard using your defined \"host\" spec property (as above).\n\n### Access using the nginx service location\n\nYou may use this access method if your OpenShift is installed on a provider that supports exposing LoadBalancer-type services.\n1. Update your DNS provider by creating a canonical name (CNAME) record.\nThis record should point to your host address and to the vfunction-nginx-xxx service location.\nFor example, ***my.domain.com.   CNAME   a05951ed7cdf-1394239323.us-east-1.elb.amazonaws.com.***\n1. Point your custom domain to the vfunction-nginx-xxx service's external IP location, which you can find in the OpenShift project > **Networking** -> **Services** -> **vfunction-nginx-xxx** service > **Service Address** > **Location** field.\n\n## Upgrade and Rollback\n\nThe vFunction operator includes a built-in auto-upgrade mechanism.\n\nYou can choose one of 4 upgrading modes:\n- **Daily**: The operator will check for a new version every day at 3 AM and will install it automatically (default).\n- **Always**: The operator will check for a new version every 10 minutes and will install it automatically.\n- **Never**: The automatic upgrading mechanism is off.\n- **Maintenance**: Put the operator in a maintenance mode.\n\nFor an on-demand upgrade,  you can change anytime the upgrading mode from \u201cNever\u201d to \u201cAlways\u201d, wait for the operand to be upgraded, and change again to \u201cNever\u201d.\n\nDuring the upgrade, the \"Operand State\" property will change to \u201cUpgrading...\u201d and back again to \u201cWorking\u201d after a successful upgrade.\n\nIn case of a failure upgrading the operand, an automatic rollback to the last working version will occur. The failed version will be marked as defective and the operator will not try to upgrade to it again.\n\nChoosing the \"Maintenance\" option will tell the operator to take down all pods, so you can safely fix storage issues, return volumes from snapshots, etc.\nAfter finishing the maintenance, return the upgrade mode to your original desired policy.",

      "csv_description": "Zettaset\u2019s RedHat Certified XCrypt Operator allows users to deploy multiple XCrypt components on OpenShift with just a few simple commands. The XCrypt Operator deployment provides software-defined encryption that transparently protects container data throughout your OpenShift environment.\n\n## Core Features\n* **Automated XCrypt provisioning** - Deploying a Zettaset XCrypt has never been easier. Adjust cluster specific configuration and let the Zettaset Operator take care of provisioning XCrypt services and setting up the XCrypt encryption to your exact specification. \n* **CSI Driver deployment**: Zettaset XCrypt Operator automatically deploys Zettaset XCrypt CSI Driver in order to provide automated and transparent data-at-rest  encryption functionality compatible with Openshift and any other container orchestrator. Once the Operator is provisioned, the driver runs fine tuned and ready to work with other XCrypt components.\n* **Multi-node topology**: Encrypt as many nodes and volumes as you need to. XCrypt components can be installed on multiple nodes across the cluster. This is defined by two labels: zts-master and zts-worker. Normally zts-master node is a single node that runs Zettaset XCrypt major services required for the product operation. Multiple nodes can be marked as zts-worker and those are the nodes that can have encrypted volumes.\n* **Seamless Encrypted Volume mount**: Volumes are not only being encrypted, but also are mounted/unmounted to containers with Persistent Volume Claims. This happens as seamlessly as regular volumes provision and mount/unmount.\n* **Robust failover**: A node failure doesn\u2019t affect XCrypt operations on other nodes of the cluster. Encryption on a restarted/recovered node gets back to normal functioning if the node stays healthy and data hasn\u2019t been corrupted during the restart\n\n## About Zettaset XCrypt Kubernetes Encryption for OpenShift\nXCrypt Kubernetes Encryption for OpenShift is a software-only solution that enables encryption of data at rest stored in Red Hat OpenShift container environments without slowing down the DevSecOps process. In addition to providing a transparent and high-performance layer of security that flexibly protects container data across on-premise, in hybrid, and multi-cloud environments, it also helps your organization efficiently transition from DevOps to DevSecOps.  \n\nMore information about Zettaset XCrypt Kubernetes Encryption for OpenShift can be found in the [Deployment and Administration Guide](https://1f2aca073706bb52f501-133f3466c38fdb0417539cdf095d8336.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/ZettasetXCryptContainerEncryption.8.5.0.Final.pdf)\n\n## RedHat OpenShift + Zettaset: The next generation of secure enterprise infrastructure for DevSecOps  \nBy combining RedHat\u2019s Container Platform with Zettaset\u2019s certified software-defined encryption, you can create the next generation of secure enterprise infrastructure that DevSecOps requires. Together they create the stable, consistent, and supported base that your organization needs to develop applications faster, simplify updates, drive innovation, and reduce the risk of potential security breaches and data theft.\n### Core Features\n* Software-only for simple and scalable deployments \n* Negligible performance impact\n* Transparent to developers and administrators \n* Works with AWS, Google, and Azure \n* Unique encryption key per container volume \n* Encrypted volumes are only available when in use\n* Direct integration with OpenShift \n* Automated encryption policy management Secure erase of volumes\n* Ability to securely decommission a node\n\n## How does XCrypt Kubernetes Encryption fit into OpenShift? \nXCrypt XCrypt Kubernetes Encryption for OpenShift Encryption makes it incredibly easy to protect container data in your OpenShift environment. \n### Use cases include:\n* Transitioning from DevOps to DevSecOps \n* Ensuring data protection in OpenShift container environments with negligible performance impact \n* Achieving compliance in regulated industries like healthcare and finance\n\n## Other Information\nRole-based access control needs to be configured prior to the Operator installation. Please find details in the [Deployment and Administration Guide](https://1f2aca073706bb52f501-133f3466c38fdb0417539cdf095d8336.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/ZettasetXCryptContainerEncryption.8.5.0.Final.pdf)    ",

IBM Security Verify SaaS provides single sign-on (SSO), multi-factor authentication (MFA), AI-powered context for risk-based authentication for adaptive access decisions, user management, access recertification campaigns and identity analytics.\n\nAs part of using Red Hat OpenShift, you are entitled to Verify SaaS SSO for unlimited apps and users.  If you do not already have a Verify SaaS SSO tenant a new one can be [created](https://www.ibm.com/account/reg/us-en/signup?formid=urx-51255).\n\nFor a detailed description of IBM Security Verify refer to the [Official documentation](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/security-verify).\n\nThe IBM Security Verify operator can consistently enforce policy-driven security by using the Ingress networking capability of OpenShift in conjunction with the [Nginx Ingress operator](https://www.nginx.com/blog/getting-started-nginx-ingress-operator-red-hat-openshift/). With this approach, you can enforce authentication and authorization policies for all of the applications in your cluster at the same time, without ever changing your application code. You can also dynamically register your application to start protecting them centrally from the cloud via Verify SaaS. \n\nSee the project [Readme](https://github.com/IBM-Security/verify-operator/blob/master/README.md) for further information and details.\n\n",

It eliminates the need for network storage and enables seamless interoperability between computing and storage in virtual environments. The Cisco HX Data Platform provides a highly fault-tolerant distributed storage system that preserves data integrity and optimizes performance for virtual machine (VM) storage workloads. In addition, native compression and deduplication reduce storage space occupied by the VMs and VM workloads.\n### HyperFlex CSI Driver\nThe Cisco HyperFlex Kubernetes CSI Integration allows Cisco HyperFlex to dynamically provide persistent storage to stateful Kubernetes workloads running on Cisco HyperFlex. The integration enables orchestration of the entire Persistent Volume object lifecycle to be offloaded and managed by Cisco HyperFlex, while being driven (initiated) by developers and users through standard Kubernetes Persistent Volume Claim objects. Developers and users get the benefit of leveraging Cisco HyperFlex for their Kubernetes persistent storage needs with zero additional administration overhead from their perspective.\n### Features Support\n- Support for CSI Spec 1.2 APIs\n- Kubernetes 1.18, 1.19, 1.20, 1.21 support\n- Kubernetes Cluster multi tenancy target masking using dedicated initiator group\n- Dynamic creation and deletion of volumes\n- Dynamic volume attach and detach\n- Block access support\n- CHAP support for iSCSI sessions\n- Clone volume (when source volume is from the same Datastore)\n- PV support with different filesystems (Ext4, Ext3, XFS)\n- Volume space statistics reporting per CSI specs\n- Multi-writer support (ReadWriteMany) for Block Mode only\n- Volume resize support for block mode volumes and ext3, ext4 filesystem volumes (expansion)\n- The HXCSI driver version 1.2.5 has been validated on HyperFlex Data Platform (HXDP) version 5.0.1a.\n",

      "csv_description": "CCM Node Agent software enables registration of the compute nodes to Fortanix CCM when installed in the Openshift Cluster Nodes\u200b. \nIt also assists with application attestation and visibility for Fortanix CCM.\n\n## About this Operator\nThis Operator is based on a Helm chart for CCM Node Agent. It enrolls all the nodes in the openshift cluster to a particular CCM account. You have to provide the base64 encode of join token of CCM account while creating CcmNodeAgent resource.\n\n## Prerequisites\nAll the worker nodes in the cluster must have SGX capabilities, in-kernel driver installed and fsgsbase support.\n\n## Installation\n * Choose a namespace to install the Operator. \n Operator will be available in all namespaces.\n* Select Approval Strategy: Available options are Automatic or Manual. Automatic approval will automatically upgrade the running instance of your Operator without human intervention when a new version is available. In case of Manual approval, when a new version is available, OLM will create an update request. You must manually approve the request to update the Operator to a new version.\n* Generate your CCM Account Join Token: Please log in to https://ccm.fortanix.com, and in the Management Console tab, click the + ENROLL NODE button. In the ENROLL NODE screen, a Join Token will be generated in the text box for \"Get a join token to register an SGX compute node\". This Join Token is used by the compute node to authenticate itself.\n* Base64 encode the Join Token:\n```shell\necho -n <join-token> | openssl base64 -A\n```\n* Create an instance of CcmNodeAgent by setting the `spec.ccmJoinToken.Token` to the base64 encoded CCM account join token.\n* After CcmNodeAgent resource is installed successfully you should be able to see all the worker nodes of the cluster in your CCM account under Compute Node Tab.\n\n## Getting Started\nNow to run your application inside SGX enclaves on your cluster follow the [documentation](https://support.fortanix.com/hc/en-us/articles/360043527431-User-s-Guide-Add-and-Edit-an-Application).\n",

Replica sets provide redundancy and high\navailability, and are the basis for all production deployments. This section\nintroduces replication in MongoDB as well as the components and architecture\nof replica sets. The section also provides tutorials for common tasks\nrelated to replica sets.\n\n* Sharded Cluster: The set of nodes comprising a sharded MongoDB deployment.\nA sharded cluster consists of config servers, shards, and one or more mongos\nrouting processes. Sharding is a A database architecture that partitions\ndata by key ranges and distributes the data among two or more database\ninstances. Sharding enables horizontal scaling.\n\n## Requirements for deploying MongoDB OpsManager\n\n* In order to deploy resources of type MongoDB OpsManager, you will need to\ncreate a secret containing the [credentials](https://docs.mongodb.com/kubernetes-operator/stable/tutorial/plan-om-resource/#om-rsrc-prereqs)\nfor the Global Onwer user\n\n## Security ##\n\nThe operator can enable TLS for all traffic between servers and also between\nclients and servers. Before enabling `security.tls.enabled` to `true` you\nshould create your certificates.  or you can leave the operator to create all\nthe certificates for you. The operator ability to create certs is been\ndepricted due to Kuberentes API changes.\n\nFor more information, please read the official MongoDB\nKubernetes Operator  [docs](https://docs.mongodb.com/kubernetes-operator/stable/).\n",

This helps them build modern applications quickly, make changes rapidly and support a variety of different data structures, models, relationships and use cases.\n* **Ensure business continuity with always-on data service** - Maintain service uptime and ensure failsafe high availability, instant failover and automatic recovery to protect your applications against unplanned downtime, outages and data loss.\n* **Design for performance and unmatched user experience** - Deliver the highest level of responsiveness and interactive customer experiences with best-in-class exceptional linear scaling high performance through a shared-nothing architecture and in-memory processing.\n* **Simplify operations with automated lifecycle management and layered orchestration** - Automate database provisioning, management and maintenance, and abstract away the complexities of high availability, seamless scale and zero-downtime upgrades with built-in support for Kubernetes and Operators.\n* **Enjoy multi-level robust security** - Provide granular control to meet self-imposed and regulatory compliance regulations and standards with built-in finegrained security controls and data encryption.\n* **Gain platform independence with flexible deployment options** - Ensure portability with multiple deployment options across any cloud of choice for multicloud and hybrid deployments and on-premises.\n* **Ensure success** - Leverage 24x7 enterprise-grade support backed by expertise in managing and scaling hundreds of thousands of Redis databases for thousands of enterprise customers worldwide.\n* **Future proof investments** - Use the most popular database amongst developers, built on open source innovation and entrenched firmly in the application landscape with over 1B downloads on Docker. Redis preserves your investment for years with easy extensibility and versatility through its Modules and support for over 50 different programming languages\n\n#### Prerequisites\nA minimum of 3 nodes which support the following requirements:\n* RAM - At least 3GB with 4GB recommended\n* Persistent Storage - At least 10GB of free space with 20GB recommended.\n* A kubernetes version of 1.9 or higher\n\n#### Recommendations/known issues\n*  Changing the name of the Redis Enterprise Cluster in the spec from the\n  default requires running commands to grant permissions to the pods:\n\n  Operator service account:\n    > *oc adm policy add-scc-to-user redis-enterprise-scc system:serviceaccount:my-project:redis-enterprise-operator*<br>\n\n    Redis Enterprise Cluster service account:\n    > *oc adm policy add-scc-to-user redis-enterprise-scc system:serviceaccount:my-project:<name of Redis Enterprise Cluster>*\n\n    Replace my-project with the actual name of the project/namespace. Replace <name of Redis Enterprise Cluster> with the name of the Redis Enterprise Cluster.\n\n* When creating a Redis Enterprise Cluster without specifying in its spec a `persistentSpec` with explicit `storageClassName`,\nthe default Storage Class of the Kubernetes cluster will be used to dynamically provision storage for the Redis Enterprise Cluster's nodes.\nHowever, if the Kubernetes cluster doesn't have a default Storage Class configured\nand no specific Storage Class was specified in the Redis Enterprise Cluster Spec, the installation of the cluster could fail.\nTo avoid such scenario in cases where a specific Storage Class isn't specified, make sure the Kubernetes Cluster has a default Storage Cluster configured.\nThis can be done by running a `kubectl get storageclass` command and see if one of the Storage Classes' names contains a `(default)` mark.",
