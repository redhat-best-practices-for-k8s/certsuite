      "csv_description": "The Dynatrace OneAgent Operator allows users to easily deploy full-stack monitoring for [OpenShift clusters](https://www.dynatrace.com/technologies/openshift-monitoring/). The Dynatrace OneAgent automatically monitors the workload running in containers down to the code and request level.\n\n### Installing the OneAgent\nOnce you've installed the Operator, you can create OneAgent custom resources to monitor your environment.\n\nFirst, please add a Secret within the Project you've deployed the Dynatrace Operator to, which would contain your API and PaaS tokens. Create tokens of type *Dynatrace API* (`API_TOKEN`) and *Platform as a Service* (`PAAS_TOKEN`) and use their values in the following commands respectively.\n\nFor assistance please refer to [Create user-generated access tokens](https://www.dynatrace.com/support/help/shortlink/token#create-user-generated-access-tokens).\n\n``` $ oc -n <project> create secret generic oneagent --from-literal=\"apiToken=API_TOKEN\" --from-literal=\"paasToken=PAAS_TOKEN\" ```\n\nYou may update this Secret at any time to rotate the tokens.\n\nThen please add an OneAgent object in the Project where the Operator has been deployed, configured to your needs.\n\n### Required Parameters\n* `apiUrl` - provide the URL to the API of your Dynatrace environment. In Dynatrace SaaS it will look like `https://<ENVIRONMENTID>.live.dynatrace.com/api` . In Dynatrace Managed like `https://<YourDynatraceServerURL>/e/<ENVIRONMENTID>/api` .\n\n### Advanced Options\n* **Image Override** - use a copy of the OneAgent container image from a registry other than Docker's or Red Hat's\n* **NodeSelectors** - select a subset of your cluster's nodes to run the Dynatrace OneAgent on, based on labels\n* **Tolerations** - add specific tolerations to the agent so that it can monitor all of the nodes in your cluster; we include the default toleration so that Dynatrace OneAgent also monitors the master nodes\n* **Priority Class Name** - define the priorityClassName for OneAgent pods\n* **Environment variables** - define environment variables for the OneAgent container\n* **Disable Certificate Checking** - disable any certificate validation that may interact poorly with proxies with in your cluster\n* **Disable OneAgent Update** - disable the Operator's auto-update feature for OneAgent pods\n* **Enable Istio Auto-config** - automatically create Istio objects for egress communication to the Dynatrace environment from the OneAgent\n\nFor a complete list of supported parameters please consult the [Operator Deploy Guide](https://www.dynatrace.com/support/help/shortlink/openshift-deploy).\n\n### Help\nYou can find more about our instructions in our [documentation](https://www.dynatrace.com/support/help/shortlink/openshift-deploy#install-oneagent-operator).\n",

      "csv_description": "Cortex Certifai empowers enterprises to identify and mitigate risk and vulnerabilities within AI and deploy trusted AI systems into production. It evaluates AI models and allows users to compare different models or model versions for the following qualities.\n* **Robustness:** measures how well models retain an outcome given changes to the data feature values. The more robust a model is, the greater the changes required to alter the outcome.\n* **Fairness by group:** measures the difference required to change the outcome for different groups implicit in a feature given the same model and dataset. For example, implicit groups male, female, and nonbinary belong to the feature, \u201cgender\u201d. A fair model shows that all 3 groups require a similar amount of change to alter the results.\n* **Explainability:** measures the average simplicity of counterfactual explanations provided for each model. An explanation that requires a single changed feature will score 100%. Explanations that require more changed features will score lower.\n* **Explanations:** display the prediction provided through the generation of counterfactuals for the change that must occur in a dataset with given restrictions to obtain a different outcome. Users can explore the entire dataset one observation at a time to understand what features changed and by how much to obtain a different result.\nSee our [documentation](https://cognitivescale.github.io/cortex-certifai/) for information about how to deploy the Certifai Operator and how to get started using our toolkit.\n## License Copyright 2020 Cognitive Scale, Inc.

Documentation for the product can be found [here](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SS5Q6W/welcome.html).\n\n### Prerequisites\n- Create \"ta\" project\n\n  In the top right corner of Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform dashboard, click on the \"+\" symbol to import YAML.\n  Insert following YAML definition and click \"Create\".  \n\n```\nkind: Project\napiVersion: project.openshift.io/v1\nmetadata:\n  name: ta\n```\n\n- Add cluster-admin role to ta-operator server account\n\n  In the top right corner of Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform dashboard, click on the \"+\" symbol to import YAML.\n  Insert following YAML definition and click \"Create\".\n\n```\nkind: ClusterRoleBinding\napiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1\nmetadata:\n  name: ta-cluster-admin\nsubjects:\n  - kind: ServiceAccount\n    name: ta-operator\n    namespace: ta\nroleRef:\n  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io\n  kind: ClusterRole\n  name: cluster-admin\n```\n\n- Create Operator Subscription\n\n  Installing the operator, in the \"Create Operator Subscription\" page, please select \"ta\" in the \"A specific namespace on the cluster\" field.\n       \n### Persistence\nPersistence can happen via  \n\n- setting up a default storage class for the system or specifying the storage class name in \"persistence.storageClassName\". In the preinstall script it will be set to \"rook-ceph-cephfs-internal\" if this storage class exists.\n\n- setting up PV with access mode specified in \"persistence.accessMode\" (default: \"ReadWriteMany\") and size specified in \"persistence.size\" (default: 8 GB). NFS PV might require the \"persistence.supplementalGroups\" to be set to access the data folder on the NFS drive.\n\n- specifying an existing PVC in \"persistence.existingClaim\"\n\nNOTE: By default access mode for persistence is set to \"ReadWriteMany\". In an install on IBM Public Cloud, it needs to be set to \"ReadWriteOnce\".\n\n### Pulling product images from entitled registry\n\nProviding image pull secret to entitled registry will make Transformation Advisor pull images from \"cp.stg.icr.io\".   \nThe secret can be passed via those set of variables which need to be added manually:\n```\ncouchdb:\n  imagePullSecret: ta-pull-secret\n\ntransadv: \n  imagePullSecret: ta-pull-secret\n\ntransadvui: \n  imagePullSecret: ta-pull-secret\n```\n\n### Access UI\nBy default, the Transformation Advisor operator exposes the UI as a Route on OpenShift. \nGo to \"Networking\" - \"Routes\" and click on the location of the ui-route.\n### LICENSE\nThis operator may be evaluated for a period of 90 days after which it may continue to be used in conjunction with IBM Cloud Pak for Applications or IBM Cloud Pak for Integration (see [License](https://www14.software.ibm.com/cgi-bin/weblap/lap.pl?li_formnum=L-NHON-BPLCV4&title=IBM%20Cloud%20Transformation%20Advisor%202.2.0)).",

      "csv_description": "# Instana\n\nInstana is an [APM solution](https://www.instana.com/product-overview/) built for microservices that enables IT Ops to build applications faster and deliver higher quality services by automating monitoring, tracing and root cause analysis. The solution is optimized for [Kubernetes](https://www.instana.com/automatic-kubernetes-monitoring/) and [OpenShift](https://www.instana.com/blog/automatic-root-cause-analysis-for-openshift-applications/).\n\n## Instana Agent Operator\n\nThis is the Kubernetes Operator for installing the Instana Agent on Kubernetes or OpenShift.\n\n## Prerequisites for OpenShift\n\nBefore the agent will be able to run in OpenShift, you need to perform a couple of extra configuration steps.\n\nYou need to set up a project for the Instana Agent and configure it's permissions.\n\nThe project you create here needs to be the namespace where you create the Instana Agent custom resource that the operator will use to deploy the agent.\n\nFor example, create the `instana-agent` project:\n\n    oc new-project instana-agent\n\nThen, ensure the `instana-agent` service account is in the privileged security context:\n\n    oc adm policy add-scc-to-user privileged -z instana-agent\n\nThis service account will be created by the operator.\n\nNow you can proceed with installing the operator for the Instana agent.\n\n## Installation and Configuration\n\nFirst, install this operator from [OperatorHub.io](https://operatorhub.io/), [OpenShift Container Platform](https://www.openshift.com/), or [OKD](https://www.okd.io/).\n\nSecond, create the target namespace where the Instana agent should be installed. The agent does not need to run in the same namespace as the operator. Most users create a new namespace `instana-agent` for running the agents.\n\nThird, create a custom resource with the agent configuration in the target namespace. The operator will pick up the custom resource and install the Instana agent accordingly.\n\nThe following is a minimal template of the custom resource:\n\n```yaml\napiVersion: instana.io/v1beta1\nkind: InstanaAgent\nmetadata:\n  name: instana-agent\n  namespace: instana-agent\nspec:\n  agent.zone.name: my-zone # (optional) name of the zone of the host\n  agent.key: replace-me # replace with your Instana agent key\n  agent.endpoint.host: ingress-red-saas.instana.io # the monitoring ingress endpoint\n  agent.endpoint.port: 443 # the monitoring ingress endpoint port, wrapped in quotes\n  agent.env:\n    INSTANA_AGENT_TAGS: example\n  cluster.name: replace-me # replace with the name of your Kubernetes cluster\n  config.files:\n    configuration.yaml: |\n      # You can leave this empty, or use this to configure your instana agent.\n      # See https://docs.instana.io/setup_and_manage/host_agent/on/kubernetes/\n```\n\nSave the template in a file `instana-agent.yaml` and edit the following values:\n\n* If your target namespace is not `instana-agent`, replace the `namespace:` accordingly.\n* `agent.key` must be set with your Instana agent key.\n* `agent.endpoint` must be set with the monitoring ingress endpoint, generally either `saas-us-west-2.instana.io` or `saas-eu-west-1.instana.io`.\n* `agent.endpoint.port` must be set with the monitoring ingress port, generally \"443\" (wrapped in quotes).\n* `agent.zone.name` should be set with the name of the Kubernetes cluster that is be displayed in Instana.\n\nFor advanced configuration, you can edit the contents of the `configuration.yaml` file. View documentation [here](https://docs.instana.io/setup_and_manage/host_agent/on/kubernetes/).\n\nApply the custom resource with `kubectl apply -f instana-agent.yaml`. After some time, you should see `instana-agent` Pods being created on each node of your cluster, and your cluster should show on the infrastructure map on your Instana Web interface.\n\n## Uninstalling\n\nIn order to uninstall the Instana agent, simply remove the custom resource with `kubectl delete -f instana-agent.yaml`.\n\n## Source Code\n\nThe Instana agent operator is an open source project hosted on [https://github.com/instana/instana-agent-operator](https://github.com/instana/instana-agent-operator/).\n",

The [Couch Replication Protocol](http://docs.couchdb.org/en/master/replication/protocol.html) is implemented in a variety of projects and products that span every imaginable computing environment from globally distributed server-clusters, over mobile phones to web browsers.\n\nStore your data safely, on your own servers, or with any leading cloud provider. Your web- and native applications love CouchDB, because it speaks JSON natively and supports binary data for all your data storage needs.\n\nThe [Couch Replication Protocol](http://docs.couchdb.org/en/master/replication/protocol.html) lets your data flow seamlessly between server clusters to mobile phones and web browsers, enabling a compelling [offline-first](http://offlinefirst.org/) user-experience while maintaining high performance and strong reliability. CouchDB comes with a developer-friendly query language, and optionally MapReduce for simple, efficient, and comprehensive data retrieval.\n\n### Operator for Apache CouchDB Features\n* Fully automated deployment and configuration of Apache CouchDB clusters.\n* Support single, multiple, or all namespace install modes.\n\n#### Security\n* TLS - TLS  is supported using Red Hat Service certificates or user-provided certificates.\n* Authentication - The parameter `require_valid_user` defaults to `true`, which means that no requests are allowed from anonymous users. Every request must be authenticated.\n* Authorization - Databases are initially accessible by Apache CouchDB admins only.\n\n#### High Availability\n* Nodes - Each database node in an Apache CouchDB cluster requires its own Kubernetes node. It's recommended that you run it with a minimum of three nodes for any production deployment.\n* Zones - The Apache CouchDB cluster database nodes are spread across available Kubernetes fault zones where available.\n* Replicas - The default configuration for each database is two shards (Q=2) and three shard copies (N=3), where each shard copy is deployed on a separate node in the cluster.\n\n### Reading and writing to Apache CouchDB\n\nThe Operator for Apache CouchDB automatically generates a Service. This can be accessed using port-forwarding e.g. `kubectl port-forward svc/my-couchdb-cluster 443:443 -u admin:mypassword`.

      "csv_description": "The PerceptiLabs operator creates and maintains PerceptiLabs, a visual tool modeling for machine learning at warp speed.\n\nPerceptiLabs visual modeling tool provides a GUI for building,\ntraining, and assessing your models, while also enabling deeper\ndevelopment with code. You get faster iterations and better\nexplainability of your results.\n\nFor more information visit [http://perceptilabs.com](http://perceptilabs.com).\n\n# Features\n\n**Fast modeling**  \nMake changes, debug, and tune your model through the GUI of custom code\neditor where every component/layer is reprogrammable. Choose from\nmultiple neural network models as well as classical AI methods.\n\n\n**Transparency of Model Performance and Results**  \nGet instant feedback about your model's performance through the\nvisualization of the architecture, to better review and understand the\nresults. See real-time analytics in every operation and variable, and\ngranular previews of output from each model component.\n\n\n**Flexibility**  \nCustomize your environment and statistics dashboard. Use high-level\nabstractions or low-level code. Execute any custom Python code or export\na fully trained TensorFlow model to perform inference in your projects.\n\n\n\n# Installation Instructions  \nFor your convenience, we've included an example quickstart for running PerceptiLabs in demo mode.\n\n## Prepare your namespace  \nChoose or create the namespace into which you'd like install PerceptiLabs. For example:  \n```\noc create namespace REPLACE_NAMESPACE\n```\n\n## Prepare storage for your data\n\nYou'll need to have a place on your cluster for storing training data and models.\n\nHere's an example configuration for creating storage on a cluster hosted on AWS that you can tailor to your needs:\n\n```\nkind: StorageClass\napiVersion: storage.k8s.io/v1\nmetadata:\n  name: perceptilabs-example-sc\n  annotations:\n    description: Example Storage for PerceptiLabs\nprovisioner: kubernetes.io/aws-ebs\nparameters:\n  fsType: ext4\n  type: gp2\nreclaimPolicy: Delete\nvolumeBindingMode: Immediate\n---\nkind: PersistentVolumeClaim\napiVersion: v1\nmetadata:\n  name: REPLACE_PVC_NAME\n  namespace: REPLACE_NAMESPACE\nspec:\n  storageClassName: perceptilabs-example-sc\n  volumeMode: Filesystem\n  accessModes:\n    - ReadWriteOnce\n  resources:\n    requests:\n      storage: 50Gi\n```\n\n## Subscribe to the PerceptiLabs operator in your namespace\n\nIf you're using the OpenShift console webpage, just click the Install button on this operator. If not, you can customize and apply this configuration:\n\n```\napiVersion: operators.coreos.com/v1\nkind: OperatorGroup\nmetadata:\n  name: REPLACE_NAMESPACE-operatorgroup\n  namespace: REPLACE_NAMESPACE\nspec:\n  targetNamespaces:\n  - REPLACE_NAMESPACE\n---\napiVersion: operators.coreos.com/v1alpha1\nkind: Subscription\nmetadata:\n  name: perceptilabs-operator\n  namespace: REPLACE_NAMESPACE\nspec:\n  channel: stable\n  name: perceptilabs-operator-package\n  source: perceptilabs-operators\n  sourceNamespace: openshift-marketplace\n  namespace: REPLACE_NAMESPACE\n```\n\nAfter this, you should see a `perceptilabs-operator` pod start up in your namespace. In that pod, the log for the `operator` container should eventually say \"starting to serve\".\n\n## Start a copy of PerceptiLabs\n\nThis is where you connect your storage and service account to a PerceptiLabs instance and run it. You can customize and apply the following configuration:\n\n```\napiVersion: perceptilabs.com/v1\nkind: PerceptiLabs\nmetadata:\n  name: example-perceptilabs\n  namespace: REPLACE_NAMESPACE\nspec:\n  corePvc: REPLACE_PVC_NAME\n```\n\nAt this point two pods named 'perceptilabs-core-...' and 'perceptilabs-frontend-...` will start up in your namespace.\n\n## Copy data files to your cluster\n\nIf you've used the persistent storage configuration from above, then you have a read-write volume mounted in the pod at `/mnt/plabs`. Copy your files there:\n\n```\noc cp REPLACE_FILENAME --namespace=REPLACE_NAMESPACE REPLACE_CORE_POD_NAME:/mnt/plabs --container=core\n```\n\n## Get the URL of your PerceptiLabs\n\nOnce everything is up and running, you'll have two new routes in your namespace. Go to the routes for your namespace and follow the link named `perceptilabs-frontend`. Your browser will be connected to your instance of PerceptiLabs! Alternatively, you can get the URL from the command line:\n\n```\noc get routes --namespace REPLACE_NAMESPACE perceptilabs-frontend\n```",

By installing this integration you will be able to deploy Zabbix server / proxies and other components with a single command.\n## Supported Features\n* **Zabbix Server** - Simple Zabbix installation with included Zabbix server, Zabbix web-interface and Zabbix Java Gateway with MySQL database support. The feature does not provide MySQL service and requires an external MySQL database. \n* **Zabbix Server (Full)** - Zabbix installation with included Zabbix server, Zabbix web-interface, Zabbix Java Gateway and MySQL server instance.\n* **Zabbix proxy (SQLite3)** - Very simple way to gain power of Zabbix proxy. The feature has  SQLite3 support for Zabbix proxies and allow to specify amount of proxies. \n* **Zabbix proxy (MySQL)** - Another option of Zabbix proxy. The option support and deliver MySQL database.\n* **Zabbix agent** - Zabbix agent can be deployed on each available node for stability and performance monitoring on remote nodes. It allows to gather metrics with full automation!\n* **Zabbix Appliance** - Zabbix appliance very simple way to test and check Zabbix features. The option provides all core components in one solution. It includes Zabbix server, Zabbix Java Gateway, Zabbix web-interface and MySQL server in deployment. It is very useful for testing Zabbix features!\n## Prerequisites\nAll deployment options are require additional information during deployment. Please, check the following instructions and provide required configuration:\n* **Zabbix Server** - MySQL database host information and MySQL database credentials in specially formatted *Secret*. Additionally it is possible to specify SSL certificates for HTTPS support in *Secret*.\n* **Zabbix Server (Full)** - MySQL database credentials in specially formatted *Secret*. MySQL database volume name information. Additionally it is possible to specify SSL certificates for HTTPS support in *Secret*.\n* **Zabbix proxy (SQLite3)** - Zabbix server host information only.\n* **Zabbix proxy (MySQL)** - MySQL database credentials in specially formatted *Secrets* and Zabbix server host information.\n* **Zabbix agent** - Zabbix server host information only for outgoing and incoming connections. Zabbix agent uses \"privileged\" mode to monitor node resources! For example, running processes.\n* **Zabbix Appliance** - MySQL database credentials in specially formatted *Secret*. MySQL database volume name information. Additionally it is possible to specify SSL certificates for HTTPS support in *Secret*.\n### MySQL credentials\n```\nkind: Secret\napiVersion: v1\nmetadata:\n  name: zabbix-full-secrets\ndata:\n  mysql_root_password: emFiYml4X3N1cGVyX3Jvb3Q= [1]\n  mysql_zabbix_password: emFiYml4X3VzZXJfcGFzc3dvcmQ= [2]\n  mysql_zabbix_username: emFiYml4 [3]\ntype: Opaque\n```\nUsing MySQL root password (*mysqlrootpassword* [1]) Zabbix server / proxy will try to create MySQL database schema with grant permissions to *mysqlzabbixusername* [2] and *mysqlzabbixpassword* [3].\n### SSL certificates for HTTPS\n```\nkind: Secret\napiVersion: v1\nmetadata:\n  name: zabbix-web-sslsecret\ndata:\n  ssl.crt: >-\n   < ssl.crt data>\n  ssl.key: >-\n\t < ssl.key data >\n  dhparam.pem: >-\n   <  dhparam.pem data >\n```\nFiles *ssl.crt*, *ssl.key* and *dhparam.perm* are required for Zabbix web-interface for SSL support.\n",

      "csv_description": "The Couchbase Autonomous Operator allows users to easily deploy, manage, and maintain Couchbase deployments on OpenShift. By installing this integration you will be able to deply Couchbase Server clusters with a single command.\n\n## Supported Features\n\n* **Automated cluster provisioning** - Deploying a Couchbase Cluster has never been easier. Fill out a Couchbase specific configuration and let the Couchbase Operator take care of provisioning nodes and setting up cluster to your exact specification.\n\n* **On-demand scalability** - Automatically scale your cluster up or down by changing a simple configuration parameter and let the Couchbase Operator handle provisioning of new nodes and joining them into the cluster.\n\n* **Auto-recovery** - Detect Couchbase node failures, rebalance out bad nodes, and bring the cluster back up to the desired capacity. Auto-recovery is completely automated so you can sleep easy through the night knowing that the Couchbase Operator will handle any failures.\n\n* **Geo-distribution** - Replicate your data between datacenters to move data closer to the users who consume it and protect against disaster scenarios where an entire datacenter becomes unavailable.\n\n* **Persistent storage** - Define persistent network-attached storage for each node in your cluster to allow pods to be recovered even if the node they were running on is no longer available.\n\n* **Rack/zone awareness** - Tell the Couchbase Operator about availability zones in your datacenter and let the operator take care of ensuring that nodes in your cluster are deployed equally across each zone.\n\n* **Supportability** - When things go wrong, use the cbopinfo tool provided with the Couchbase Operator to collect relevant data about your Couchbase deployment so that you can quickly address issues.\n\n* **Centralized configuration management** - Manage your configuration centrally with OpenShift. Updates to the configuration are watched by the Couchbase Operator and actions are taken to make the target cluster match the desired configuration.\n## Required Parameters\n* `authSecret` - provide the name of a secret that contains two keys for the `username` and `password` of the super user ([documentation](https://docs.couchbase.com/operator/1.2/couchbase-cluster-config.html))\n\n## About Couchbase Server\n\nBuilt on the most powerful NoSQL technology, Couchbase Server delivers unparalleled performance at scale, in any cloud. With features like memory-first architecture, geo-distributed deployments, and workload isolation, Couchbase Server excels at supporting mission-critical applications at scale while maintaining submillisecond latencies and 99.999% availability. Plus, with the most comprehensive SQL-compatible query language (N1QL), migrating from RDBMS to Couchbase Server is easy with ANSI joins.\n",

      "csv_description": "# Instana\n\nInstana is an [APM solution](https://www.instana.com/product-overview/) built for microservices that enables IT Ops to build applications faster and deliver higher quality services by automating monitoring, tracing and root cause analysis. The solution is optimized for [Kubernetes](https://www.instana.com/automatic-kubernetes-monitoring/) and [OpenShift](https://www.instana.com/blog/automatic-root-cause-analysis-for-openshift-applications/).\n\n## Instana Agent Operator\n\nThis is the Kubernetes Operator for installing the Instana Agent on Kubernetes or OpenShift.\n\n## Prerequisites for OpenShift\n\nBefore the agent will be able to run in OpenShift, you need to perform a couple of extra configuration steps.\n\nYou need to set up a project for the Instana Agent and configure it's permissions.\n\nThe project you create here needs to be the namespace where you create the Instana Agent custom resource that the operator will use to deploy the agent.\n\nFor example, create the `instana-agent` project:\n\n    oc new-project instana-agent\n\nThen, ensure the `instana-agent` service account is in the privileged security context:\n\n    oc adm policy add-scc-to-user privileged -z instana-agent\n\nThis service account will be created by the operator.\n\nNow you can proceed with installing the operator for the Instana agent.\n\n## Installation and Configuration\n\nFirst, install this operator from [OperatorHub.io](https://operatorhub.io/), [OpenShift Container Platform](https://www.openshift.com/), or [OKD](https://www.okd.io/).\n\nSecond, create the target namespace where the Instana agent should be installed. The agent does not need to run in the same namespace as the operator. Most users create a new namespace `instana-agent` for running the agents.\n\nThird, create a custom resource with the agent configuration in the target namespace. The operator will pick up the custom resource and install the Instana agent accordingly.\n\nThe following is a minimal template of the custom resource:\n\n```yaml\napiVersion: instana.io/v1beta1\nkind: InstanaAgent\nmetadata:\n  name: instana-agent\n  namespace: instana-agent\nspec:\n  agent.zone.name: my-zone # (optional) name of the zone of the host\n  agent.key: replace-me # replace with your Instana agent key\n  agent.endpoint.host: ingress-red-saas.instana.io # the monitoring ingress endpoint\n  agent.endpoint.port: 443 # the monitoring ingress endpoint port, wrapped in quotes\n  agent.env:\n    INSTANA_AGENT_TAGS: example\n  cluster.name: replace-me # replace with the name of your Kubernetes cluster\n  config.files:\n    configuration.yaml: |\n      # You can leave this empty, or use this to configure your instana agent.\n      # See https://docs.instana.io/setup_and_manage/host_agent/on/kubernetes/\n```\n\nSave the template in a file `instana-agent.yaml` and edit the following values:\n\n* If your target namespace is not `instana-agent`, replace the `namespace:` accordingly.\n* `agent.key` must be set with your Instana agent key.\n* `agent.endpoint` must be set with the monitoring ingress endpoint, generally either `saas-us-west-2.instana.io` or `saas-eu-west-1.instana.io`.\n* `agent.endpoint.port` must be set with the monitoring ingress port, generally \"443\" (wrapped in quotes).\n* `agent.zone.name` should be set with the name of the Kubernetes cluster that is be displayed in Instana.\n\nFor advanced configuration, you can edit the contents of the `configuration.yaml` file. View documentation [here](https://docs.instana.io/setup_and_manage/host_agent/on/kubernetes/).\n\nApply the custom resource with `kubectl apply -f instana-agent.yaml`. After some time, you should see `instana-agent` Pods being created on each node of your cluster, and your cluster should show on the infrastructure map on your Instana Web interface.\n\n## Uninstalling\n\nIn order to uninstall the Instana agent, simply remove the custom resource with `kubectl delete -f instana-agent.yaml`.\n\n## Source Code\n\nThe Instana agent operator is an open source project hosted on [https://github.com/instana/instana-agent-operator](https://github.com/instana/instana-agent-operator/).\n",

The Dynatrace OneAgent automatically monitors the workload running in containers down to the code and request level.\n\n### Installing the OneAgent\nOnce you've installed the Operator, you can create OneAgent custom resources to monitor your environment.\n\nFirst, please add a Secret within the Project you've deployed the Dynatrace Operator to, which would contain your API and PaaS tokens. Create tokens of type *Dynatrace API* (`API_TOKEN`) and *Platform as a Service* (`PAAS_TOKEN`) and use their values in the following commands respectively.\n\nFor assistance please refer to [Create user-generated access tokens](https://www.dynatrace.com/support/help/shortlink/token#create-user-generated-access-tokens).\n\n``` $ oc -n <project> create secret generic oneagent --from-literal=\"apiToken=API_TOKEN\" --from-literal=\"paasToken=PAAS_TOKEN\" ```\n\nYou may update this Secret at any time to rotate the tokens.\n\nThen please add an OneAgent object in the Project where the Operator has been deployed, configured to your needs.\n\n### Required Parameters\n* `apiUrl` - provide the URL to the API of your Dynatrace environment. In Dynatrace SaaS it will look like `https://<ENVIRONMENTID>.live.dynatrace.com/api` . In Dynatrace Managed like `https://<YourDynatraceServerURL>/e/<ENVIRONMENTID>/api` .\n\n### Advanced Options\n* **Image Override** - use a copy of the OneAgent container image from a registry other than Docker's or Red Hat's\n* **NodeSelectors** - select a subset of your cluster's nodes to run the Dynatrace OneAgent on, based on labels\n* **Tolerations** - add specific tolerations to the agent so that it can monitor all of the nodes in your cluster; we include the default toleration so that Dynatrace OneAgent also monitors the master nodes\n* **Priority Class Name** - define the priorityClassName for OneAgent pods\n* **Environment variables** - define environment variables for the OneAgent container\n* **Disable Certificate Checking** - disable any certificate validation that may interact poorly with proxies with in your cluster\n* **Disable OneAgent Update** - disable the Operator's auto-update feature for OneAgent pods\n* **Enable Istio Auto-config** - automatically create Istio objects for egress communication to the Dynatrace environment from the OneAgent\n\nFor a complete list of supported parameters please consult the [Operator Deploy Guide](https://www.dynatrace.com/support/help/shortlink/openshift-deploy).\n\n### Help\nYou can find more about our instructions in our [documentation](https://www.dynatrace.com/support/help/shortlink/openshift-deploy#install-oneagent-operator).\n",

      "csv_description": "Cortex Certifai empowers enterprises to identify and mitigate risk and vulnerabilities within AI and deploy trusted AI systems into production. It evaluates AI models and allows users to compare different models or model versions for the following qualities.\n* **Robustness:** measures how well models retain an outcome given changes to the data feature values. The more robust a model is, the greater the changes required to alter the outcome.\n* **Fairness by group:** measures the difference required to change the outcome for different groups implicit in a feature given the same model and dataset. For example, implicit groups male, female, and nonbinary belong to the feature, \u201cgender\u201d. A fair model shows that all 3 groups require a similar amount of change to alter the results.\n* **Explainability:** measures the average simplicity of counterfactual explanations provided for each model. An explanation that requires a single changed feature will score 100%. Explanations that require more changed features will score lower.\n* **Explanations:** display the prediction provided through the generation of counterfactuals for the change that must occur in a dataset with given restrictions to obtain a different outcome. Users can explore the entire dataset one observation at a time to understand what features changed and by how much to obtain a different result.\nSee our [documentation](https://cognitivescale.github.io/cortex-certifai/) for information about how to deploy the Certifai Operator and how to get started using our toolkit.\n## License Copyright 2020 Cognitive Scale, Inc.
