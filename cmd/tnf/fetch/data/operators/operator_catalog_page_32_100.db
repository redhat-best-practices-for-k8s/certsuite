Make sure you have a license and to obtain one, please contact Aqua Security at [Contact Us](mailto:cloudsales@aquasec.com).\n2. Create a new project for aqua\n\n    ```oc new-project aqua```\n3. Create the secret for Aqua Database password\n\n    ```oc create secret generic aqua-database-password --from-literal=db-password=<password>```\n    \nPlease note that for the certified operator, the Docker registry secret is NOT needed. For the Red Hat certified operator, the Aqua application images are stored in the Red Hat Connect registry and will be automatically pulled by the Aqua operator.\n\n## Choosing the right channel\n\nChannels are a flexible publishing mechanism that offers you three different Aqua versions to deploy, at any point. These channels map to their respective Aqua versions, describing the maturity based on where they are in their lifecycle:\n* latest: This maps to the Aqua version 4.6.0\n* alpha: This maps to the Aqua version 5.0.0\n* 5.3: This is the latest and greatest version of Aqua (default)\n\n## Deploying the Aqua Operator\n\nAqua Operator follows an easy push button deployment that installs the operator in its own aqua namespace.\nPlease refer to the instructions [here](https://github.com/aquasecurity/aqua-operator/blob/5.3.0/docs/DeployOpenShiftOperator.md).\n\n## Configuring the Aqua Operator\n\nOperators leverage CRDs as a configuration mechanism for the application. Aqua offers a number of CRDs that can be tweaked and configured as per your needs. Please refer to this [link](https://github.com/aquasecurity/aqua-operator/blob/5.3.0/docs/DeployOpenShiftOperator.md#aquacsp-crds) for Custom Resource examples for popular scenarios.\n\n## Support\n\nFor support please contact support@aquasec.com.",

Replica sets provide redundancy and high\navailability, and are the basis for all production deployments. This section\nintroduces replication in MongoDB as well as the components and architecture\nof replica sets. The section also provides tutorials for common tasks\nrelated to replica sets.\n\n* Sharded Cluster: The set of nodes comprising a sharded MongoDB deployment.\nA sharded cluster consists of config servers, shards, and one or more mongos\nrouting processes. Sharding is a A database architecture that partitions\ndata by key ranges and distributes the data among two or more database\ninstances. Sharding enables horizontal scaling.\n\n## Requirements for deploying MongoDB OpsManager\n\n* In order to deploy resources of type MongoDB OpsManager, you will need to\ncreate a secret containing the [credentials](https://docs.mongodb.com/kubernetes-operator/stable/tutorial/plan-om-resource/#om-rsrc-prereqs)\nfor the Global Onwer user\n\n## Security ##\n\nThe operator can enable TLS for all traffic between servers and also between\nclients and servers. Before enabling `security.tls.enabled` to `true` you\nshould create your certificates.  or you can leave the operator to create all\nthe certificates for you. The operator ability to create certs is been\ndepricted due to Kuberentes API changes.\n\nFor more information, please read the official MongoDB\nKubernetes Operator  [docs](https://docs.mongodb.com/kubernetes-operator/stable/).\n",

      "csv_description": "The MongoDB Enterprise Kubernetes Operator enables easy deploys of MongoDB\ninto Kubernetes clusters, using our management, monitoring and backup\nplatforms, Ops Manager and Cloud Manager.\n\n## Before You Start\n\nTo start using the operator you''ll need an account in MongoDB Cloud Manager or\na MongoDB Ops Manager deployment.\n\n* [Create a Secret with your OpsManager API key](https://docs.mongodb.com/kubernetes-operator/stable/tutorial/create-operator-credentials/#procedure)\n\n* [Create a ConfigMap with your OpsManager project ID and URL](https://docs.mongodb.com/kubernetes-operator/stable/tutorial/create-project-using-configmap/)\n\nBy installing this integration, you will be able to deploy MongoDB instances\nwith a single simple command.\n\n## Required Parameters\n\n* `opsManager` or `cloudManager` - Enter the name of the ConfigMap containing project information\n* `credentials` - Enter the name of the Secret containing your OpsManager credentials\n* `type` - Enter MongoDB Deployment Types (\"Standalone\", \"ReplicaSet\", \"ShardedCluster\"\n\n## Supported MongoDB Deployment Types ##\n\n* Standalone: An instance of mongod that is running as a single server and\nnot as part of a replica set, this is, it does not do any kind of\nreplication.\n\n* Replica Set: A replica set in MongoDB is a group of mongod processes that\nmaintain the same data set. Replica sets provide redundancy and high\navailability, and are the basis for all production deployments. This section\nintroduces replication in MongoDB as well as the components and architecture\nof replica sets. The section also provides tutorials for common tasks\nrelated to replica sets.\n\n* Sharded Cluster: The set of nodes comprising a sharded MongoDB deployment.\nA sharded cluster consists of config servers, shards, and one or more mongos\nrouting processes. Sharding is a A database architecture that partitions\ndata by key ranges and distributes the data among two or more database\ninstances. Sharding enables horizontal scaling.\n\n## Requirements for deploying MongoDB OpsManager\n\n* In order to deploy resources of type MongoDB OpsManager, you will need to\ncreate a secret containing the [credentials](https://docs.mongodb.com/kubernetes-operator/stable/tutorial/plan-om-resource/#om-rsrc-prereqs)\nfor the Global Onwer user\n\n## Security ##\n\nThe operator can enable TLS for all traffic between servers and also between\nclients and servers. Before enabling `security.tls.enabled` to `true` you\nshould create your certificates.  or you can leave the operator to create all\nthe certificates for you. The operator ability to create certs is been\ndepricted due to Kuberentes API changes.\n\nFor more information, please read the official MongoDB\nKubernetes Operator  [docs](https://docs.mongodb.com/kubernetes-operator/stable/).\n",

Replica sets provide redundancy and high\navailability, and are the basis for all production deployments. This section\nintroduces replication in MongoDB as well as the components and architecture\nof replica sets. The section also provides tutorials for common tasks\nrelated to replica sets.\n\n* Sharded Cluster: The set of nodes comprising a sharded MongoDB deployment.\nA sharded cluster consists of config servers, shards, and one or more mongos\nrouting processes. Sharding is a A database architecture that partitions\ndata by key ranges and distributes the data among two or more database\ninstances. Sharding enables horizontal scaling.\n\n## Requirements for deploying MongoDB OpsManager\n\n* In order to deploy resources of type MongoDB OpsManager, you will need to\ncreate a secret containing the [credentials](https://docs.mongodb.com/kubernetes-operator/stable/tutorial/plan-om-resource/#om-rsrc-prereqs)\nfor the Global Onwer user\n\n## Security ##\n\nThe operator can enable TLS for all traffic between servers and also between\nclients and servers. Before enabling `security.tls.enabled` to `true` you\nshould create your certificates.  or you can leave the operator to create all\nthe certificates for you. The operator ability to create certs is been\ndepricted due to Kuberentes API changes.\n\nFor more information, please read the official MongoDB\nKubernetes Operator  [docs](https://docs.mongodb.com/kubernetes-operator/stable/).\n",

Replica sets provide redundancy and high\navailability, and are the basis for all production deployments. This section\nintroduces replication in MongoDB as well as the components and architecture\nof replica sets. The section also provides tutorials for common tasks\nrelated to replica sets.\n\n* Sharded Cluster: The set of nodes comprising a sharded MongoDB deployment.\nA sharded cluster consists of config servers, shards, and one or more mongos\nrouting processes. Sharding is a A database architecture that partitions\ndata by key ranges and distributes the data among two or more database\ninstances. Sharding enables horizontal scaling.\n\n## Requirements for deploying MongoDB OpsManager\n\n* In order to deploy resources of type MongoDB OpsManager, you will need to\ncreate a secret containing the [credentials](https://docs.mongodb.com/kubernetes-operator/stable/tutorial/plan-om-resource/#om-rsrc-prereqs)\nfor the Global Onwer user\n\n## Security ##\n\nThe operator can enable TLS for all traffic between servers and also between\nclients and servers. Before enabling `security.tls.enabled` to `true` you\nshould create your certificates.  or you can leave the operator to create all\nthe certificates for you. The operator ability to create certs is been\ndepricted due to Kuberentes API changes.\n\nFor more information, please read the official MongoDB\nKubernetes Operator  [docs](https://docs.mongodb.com/kubernetes-operator/stable/).\n",

The operator automatically installs the required host networking software - bringing together all the needed components to provide high-speed network connectivity. These components include the NVIDIA networking driver, Kubernetes device plugin, CNI plugins, IP address management (IPAM) plugin and others.\nThe NVIDIA Network Operator works in conjunction with the NVIDIA GPU Operator to deliver high-throughput, low-latency networking for scale-out, GPU computing clusters.\n\nThe Network Operator uses Node Feature Discovery (NFD) labels in order to properly schedule resources.\nNodes can be labelled manually or using the NFD Operator. An example of `NodeFeatureDiscovery`\nconfiguration is available in the documentation.\nThe following NFD labels are used:\n`feature.node.kubernetes.io/pci-15b3.present` for nodes containing NVIDIA Networking hardware.\n`feature.node.kubernetes.io/pci-10de.present` for nodes containing NVIDIA GPU hardware.\n\nThe Network Operator is open-source.

GitLab Runner works in conjunction with GitLab CI/CD, the open-source continuous integration service included with GitLab.\n\nThe GitLab Runner operator manages the lifecycle of GitLab Runner in Kubernetes or Openshift clusters. The operator aims to automate the tasks needed to run your CI/CD jobs in your container orchestration platform.\n\n## Prerequisites\n\n  Install cert-manager:\n\n  ```shell\n  kubectl apply -f https://github.com/jetstack/cert-manager/releases/download/v1.7.1/cert-manager.yaml\n  ```\n\n## GitLab Runner version\n\nThis version of **GitLab Runner Operator** ships with **GitLab Runner v15.0.0**.\n\nTo use a different version of **GitLab Runner** change the [`runnerImage` and `helperImage` properties](https://docs.gitlab.com/runner/configuration/configuring_runner_operator.html#operator-properties).\n\n## Usage\n\n To link a GitLab Runner instance to a self-hosted GitLab instance or the hosted [GitLab](https://gitlab.com), you first need to:\n\n 1. Create a secret containing the `runner-registration-token` from your GitLab project.\n\n   ```\n  cat > gitlab-runner-secret.yml << EOF\n  apiVersion: v1\n  kind: Secret\n  metadata:\n    name: gitlab-runner-secret\n  type: Opaque\n  stringData:\n    runner-registration-token: REPLACE_ME # your project runner secret\n  EOF\n  ```\n\n  ```\n  oc apply -f gitlab-runner-secret.yml\n  ```\n\n 2. Create the Custom Resource Definition (CRD) file and include the following information. The tags value must be openshift for the job to run.\n\n   ```\n   cat > gitlab-runner.yml << EOF\n   apiVersion: apps.gitlab.com/v1beta2\n   kind: Runner\n   metadata:\n     name: gitlab-runner\n   spec:\n     gitlabUrl: https://gitlab.example.com\n     buildImage: alpine\n     token: gitlab-runner-secret\n     tags: openshift\n   EOF\n   ```\n\n  ```\n  oc apply -f gitlab-runner.yml\n  ```\n\n## Full documentation\n\nVisit [Install GitLab Runner Operator](https://docs.gitlab.com/runner/install/operator.html)\n",

IBM Security Verify SaaS provides single sign-on (SSO), multi-factor authentication (MFA), AI-powered context for risk-based authentication for adaptive access decisions, user management, access recertification campaigns and identity analytics.\n\nAs part of using Red Hat OpenShift, you are entitled to Verify SaaS SSO for unlimited apps and users.  If you do not already have a Verify SaaS SSO tenant a new one can be [created](https://www.ibm.com/account/reg/us-en/signup?formid=urx-51255).\n\nFor a detailed description of IBM Security Verify refer to the [Official documentation](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/security-verify).\n\nThe IBM Security Verify operator can consistently enforce policy-driven security by using the Ingress networking capability of OpenShift in conjunction with the [Nginx Ingress operator](https://www.nginx.com/blog/getting-started-nginx-ingress-operator-red-hat-openshift/). With this approach, you can enforce authentication and authorization policies for all of the applications in your cluster at the same time, without ever changing your application code. You can also dynamically register your application to start protecting them centrally from the cloud via Verify SaaS. \n\nSee the project [Readme](https://github.com/IBM-Security/verify-operator/blob/master/README.md) for further information and details.\n\n",
