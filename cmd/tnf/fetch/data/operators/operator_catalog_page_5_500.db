Linear scalability and\nproven fault-tolerance on commodity hardware or cloud infrastructure make it the\nperfect platform for mission-critical data. Cassandra's support for replicating\nacross multiple datacenters is best-in-class, providing lower latency for your\nusers and the peace of mind of knowing that you can survive regional outages.\n\n## DataStax Enterprise\n\nThe most advanced distribution of Apache Cassandra\u2122 on the market, with the\nenterprise functionality needed for serious production systems and backed up and\nsupported by the best distributed-experts in the world. It's one platform for\nall types of applications anywhere, any cloud, any model: key-value, graph,\ntabular, JSON.\n\nDataStax Enterprise is a fully integrated and optimized database, with graph,\nanalytics, and search included, all with a unified security model. Simply put,\nit's the only database capable of meeting today's demanding requirements\n\n## Operator Details\n\n`cass-operator` is designed as a modular operator for Apache Cassandra and\nderived  distributions. Apache Cassandra is a distributed database consisting of\nmultiple nodes working in concert to store data and process queries along a\nnumber of fault domains. `cass-operator` has the deployment of a Cassandra\ncluster around the logical domain of a datacenter with the `CassandraDatacenter`\ncustom resource.\n    \nUpon submission of one of these resources it handles provisioning the underlying\nstateful sets (analogous to C\\* logical racks), services, and configuration.\nAdditionally through monitoring pod state via Kubernetes callbacks it handles day to day\noperations such as restarting failed processes, scaling clusters up, and deploying\nconfiguration changes in a rolling, non-disruptive, fashion.\n    \nThis operator is designed to be `Namespace` scoped. A single Kubernetes cluster may\nbe running multiple instances of this operator, in separate namespaces, to support\na number of C\\* clusters and environments. Configuration is simple with the usage of\nYAML based overrides in the Custom Resource paired with an `init` container.\n    \nIn C\\* clusters ordering and timing of certain operations are important to keep the system\nevenly distributed. `cass-operator` takes advantage of a sidecar process within the\nmain container to handle the orchestration of starting our main C* process.",

Linear scalability and\nproven fault-tolerance on commodity hardware or cloud infrastructure make it the\nperfect platform for mission-critical data. Cassandra's support for replicating\nacross multiple datacenters is best-in-class, providing lower latency for your\nusers and the peace of mind of knowing that you can survive regional outages.\n\n## DataStax Enterprise\n\nThe most advanced distribution of Apache Cassandra\u2122 on the market, with the\nenterprise functionality needed for serious production systems and backed up and\nsupported by the best distributed-experts in the world. It's one platform for\nall types of applications anywhere, any cloud, any model: key-value, graph,\ntabular, JSON.\n\nDataStax Enterprise is a fully integrated and optimized database, with graph,\nanalytics, and search included, all with a unified security model. Simply put,\nit's the only database capable of meeting today's demanding requirements\n\n## Operator Details\n\n`cass-operator` is designed as a modular operator for Apache Cassandra and\nderived  distributions. Apache Cassandra is a distributed database consisting of\nmultiple nodes working in concert to store data and process queries along a\nnumber of fault domains. `cass-operator` has the deployment of a Cassandra\ncluster around the logical domain of a datacenter with the `CassandraDatacenter`\ncustom resource.\n    \nUpon submission of one of these resources it handles provisioning the underlying\nstateful sets (analogous to C\\* logical racks), services, and configuration.\nAdditionally through monitoring pod state via Kubernetes callbacks it handles day to day\noperations such as restarting failed processes, scaling clusters up, and deploying\nconfiguration changes in a rolling, non-disruptive, fashion.\n    \nThis operator is designed to be `Namespace` scoped. A single Kubernetes cluster may\nbe running multiple instances of this operator, in separate namespaces, to support\na number of C\\* clusters and environments. Configuration is simple with the usage of\nYAML based overrides in the Custom Resource paired with an `init` container.\n    \nIn C\\* clusters ordering and timing of certain operations are important to keep the system\nevenly distributed. `cass-operator` takes advantage of a sidecar process within the\nmain container to handle the orchestration of starting our main C* process.",

Replica sets provide redundancy and high\navailability, and are the basis for all production deployments. This section\nintroduces replication in MongoDB as well as the components and architecture\nof replica sets. The section also provides tutorials for common tasks\nrelated to replica sets.\n\n* Sharded Cluster: The set of nodes comprising a sharded MongoDB deployment.\nA sharded cluster consists of config servers, shards, and one or more mongos\nrouting processes. Sharding is a A database architecture that partitions\ndata by key ranges and distributes the data among two or more database\ninstances. Sharding enables horizontal scaling.\n\n## Requirements for deploying MongoDB OpsManager\n\n* In order to deploy resources of type MongoDB OpsManager, you will need to\ncreate a secret containing the [credentials](https://docs.mongodb.com/kubernetes-operator/stable/tutorial/plan-om-resource/#om-rsrc-prereqs)\nfor the Global Onwer user\n\n## Security ##\n\nThe operator can enable TLS for all traffic between servers and also between\nclients and servers. Before enabling `security.tls.enabled` to `true` you\nshould create your certificates.  or you can leave the operator to create all\nthe certificates for you. The operator ability to create certs is been\ndepricted due to Kuberentes API changes.\n\nFor more information, please read the official MongoDB\nKubernetes Operator  [docs](https://docs.mongodb.com/kubernetes-operator/stable/).\n",

Linear scalability and\nproven fault-tolerance on commodity hardware or cloud infrastructure make it the\nperfect platform for mission-critical data. Cassandra's support for replicating\nacross multiple datacenters is best-in-class, providing lower latency for your\nusers and the peace of mind of knowing that you can survive regional outages.\n\n## DataStax Enterprise\n\nThe most advanced distribution of Apache Cassandra\u2122 on the market, with the\nenterprise functionality needed for serious production systems and backed up and\nsupported by the best distributed-experts in the world. It's one platform for\nall types of applications anywhere, any cloud, any model: key-value, graph,\ntabular, JSON.\n\nDataStax Enterprise is a fully integrated and optimized database, with graph,\nanalytics, and search included, all with a unified security model. Simply put,\nit's the only database capable of meeting today's demanding requirements\n\n## Operator Details\n\n`cass-operator` is designed as a modular operator for Apache Cassandra and\nderived  distributions. Apache Cassandra is a distributed database consisting of\nmultiple nodes working in concert to store data and process queries along a\nnumber of fault domains. `cass-operator` has the deployment of a Cassandra\ncluster around the logical domain of a datacenter with the `CassandraDatacenter`\ncustom resource.\n    \nUpon submission of one of these resources it handles provisioning the underlying\nstateful sets (analogous to C\\* logical racks), services, and configuration.\nAdditionally through monitoring pod state via Kubernetes callbacks it handles day to day\noperations such as restarting failed processes, scaling clusters up, and deploying\nconfiguration changes in a rolling, non-disruptive, fashion.\n    \nThis operator is designed to be `Namespace` scoped. A single Kubernetes cluster may\nbe running multiple instances of this operator, in separate namespaces, to support\na number of C\\* clusters and environments. Configuration is simple with the usage of\nYAML based overrides in the Custom Resource paired with an `init` container.\n    \nIn C\\* clusters ordering and timing of certain operations are important to keep the system\nevenly distributed. `cass-operator` takes advantage of a sidecar process within the\nmain container to handle the orchestration of starting our main C* process.",

Replica sets provide redundancy and high\navailability, and are the basis for all production deployments. This section\nintroduces replication in MongoDB as well as the components and architecture\nof replica sets. The section also provides tutorials for common tasks\nrelated to replica sets.\n\n* Sharded Cluster: The set of nodes comprising a sharded MongoDB deployment.\nA sharded cluster consists of config servers, shards, and one or more mongos\nrouting processes. Sharding is a A database architecture that partitions\ndata by key ranges and distributes the data among two or more database\ninstances. Sharding enables horizontal scaling.\n\n## Requirements for deploying MongoDB OpsManager\n\n* In order to deploy resources of type MongoDB OpsManager, you will need to\ncreate a secret containing the [credentials](https://docs.mongodb.com/kubernetes-operator/stable/tutorial/plan-om-resource/#om-rsrc-prereqs)\nfor the Global Onwer user\n\n## Security ##\n\nThe operator can enable TLS for all traffic between servers and also between\nclients and servers. Before enabling `security.tls.enabled` to `true` you\nshould create your certificates.  or you can leave the operator to create all\nthe certificates for you. The operator ability to create certs is been\ndepricted due to Kuberentes API changes.\n\nFor more information, please read the official MongoDB\nKubernetes Operator  [docs](https://docs.mongodb.com/kubernetes-operator/stable/).\n",

      "csv_description": "Apache CouchDB lets you access your data where you need it. The [Couch Replication Protocol](http://docs.couchdb.org/en/master/replication/protocol.html) is implemented in a variety of projects and products that span every imaginable computing environment from globally distributed server-clusters, over mobile phones to web browsers.\n\nStore your data safely, on your own servers, or with any leading cloud provider. Your web- and native applications love CouchDB, because it speaks JSON natively and supports binary data for all your data storage needs.\n\nThe [Couch Replication Protocol](http://docs.couchdb.org/en/master/replication/protocol.html) lets your data flow seamlessly between server clusters to mobile phones and web browsers, enabling a compelling [offline-first](http://offlinefirst.org/) user-experience while maintaining high performance and strong reliability. CouchDB comes with a developer-friendly query language, and optionally MapReduce for simple, efficient, and comprehensive data retrieval.\n\n### Operator for Apache CouchDB Features\n* Fully automated deployment and configuration of Apache CouchDB clusters.\n* Support single, multiple, or all namespace install modes.\n\n#### Security\n* TLS - TLS  is supported using Red Hat Service certificates or user-provided certificates.\n* Authentication - The parameter `require_valid_user` defaults to `true`, which means that no requests are allowed from anonymous users. Every request must be authenticated.\n* Authorization - Databases are initially accessible by Apache CouchDB admins only.\n\n#### High Availability\n* Nodes - Each database node in an Apache CouchDB cluster requires its own Kubernetes node. It's recommended that you run it with a minimum of three nodes for any production deployment.\n* Zones - The Apache CouchDB cluster database nodes are spread across available Kubernetes fault zones where available.\n* Replicas - The default configuration for each database is two shards (Q=2) and three shard copies (N=3), where each shard copy is deployed on a separate node in the cluster.\n\n### Reading and writing to Apache CouchDB\n\nThe Operator for Apache CouchDB automatically generates a Service. This can be accessed using port-forwarding e.g. `kubectl port-forward svc/my-couchdb-cluster 443:443 -u admin:mypassword`. Alternatively, configure an OpenShift Route to expose the service externally.\n\n### CouchDB 2.3.1 Update Instructions\nWhen the operator is updated to v2.0 or above any existing CouchDB 2.3.1 cluster will not be automatically upgraded to CouchDB 3. The user must manually trigger this process by removing the version statement `version: 2.3.1` in the CouchDBCluster CR for each CouchDB cluster\nThe operator will then perform a rolling update, with the new pods running CouchDB3.\nIt is advised that customers do this straightaway as CouchDB 2.3.1 is no longer supported.\n\n[Read the complete guide to using the Operator for Apache CouchDB](https://ibm.biz/BdfGQy)\n",

      "csv_description": "Apache CouchDB lets you access your data where you need it. The [Couch Replication Protocol](http://docs.couchdb.org/en/master/replication/protocol.html) is implemented in a variety of projects and products that span every imaginable computing environment from globally distributed server-clusters, over mobile phones to web browsers.\n\nStore your data safely, on your own servers, or with any leading cloud provider. Your web- and native applications love CouchDB, because it speaks JSON natively and supports binary data for all your data storage needs.\n\nThe [Couch Replication Protocol](http://docs.couchdb.org/en/master/replication/protocol.html) lets your data flow seamlessly between server clusters to mobile phones and web browsers, enabling a compelling [offline-first](http://offlinefirst.org/) user-experience while maintaining high performance and strong reliability. CouchDB comes with a developer-friendly query language, and optionally MapReduce for simple, efficient, and comprehensive data retrieval.\n\n### Operator for Apache CouchDB Features\n* Fully automated deployment and configuration of Apache CouchDB clusters.\n* Support single, multiple, or all namespace install modes.\n\n#### Security\n* TLS - TLS  is supported using Red Hat Service certificates or user-provided certificates.\n* Authentication - The parameter `require_valid_user` defaults to `true`, which means that no requests are allowed from anonymous users. Every request must be authenticated.\n* Authorization - Databases are initially accessible by Apache CouchDB admins only.\n\n#### High Availability\n* Nodes - Each database node in an Apache CouchDB cluster requires its own Kubernetes node. It's recommended that you run it with a minimum of three nodes for any production deployment.\n* Zones - The Apache CouchDB cluster database nodes are spread across available Kubernetes fault zones where available.\n* Replicas - The default configuration for each database is two shards (Q=2) and three shard copies (N=3), where each shard copy is deployed on a separate node in the cluster.\n\n### Reading and writing to Apache CouchDB\n\nThe Operator for Apache CouchDB automatically generates a Service. This can be accessed using port-forwarding e.g. `kubectl port-forward svc/my-couchdb-cluster 443:443 -u admin:mypassword`. Alternatively, configure an OpenShift Route to expose the service externally.\n\n### CouchDB 2.3.1 Update Instructions\nWhen the operator is updated to v2.0 or above any existing CouchDB 2.3.1 cluster will not be automatically upgraded to CouchDB 3. The user must manually trigger this process by removing the version statement `version: 2.3.1` in the CouchDBCluster CR for each CouchDB cluster\nThe operator will then perform a rolling update, with the new pods running CouchDB3.\nIt is advised that customers do this straightaway as CouchDB 2.3.1 is no longer supported.\n\n[Read the complete guide to using the Operator for Apache CouchDB](https://ibm.biz/BdfGQy)\n",

The [Couch Replication Protocol](http://docs.couchdb.org/en/master/replication/protocol.html) is implemented in a variety of projects and products that span every imaginable computing environment from globally distributed server-clusters, over mobile phones to web browsers.\n\nStore your data safely, on your own servers, or with any leading cloud provider. Your web- and native applications love CouchDB, because it speaks JSON natively and supports binary data for all your data storage needs.\n\nThe [Couch Replication Protocol](http://docs.couchdb.org/en/master/replication/protocol.html) lets your data flow seamlessly between server clusters to mobile phones and web browsers, enabling a compelling [offline-first](http://offlinefirst.org/) user-experience while maintaining high performance and strong reliability. CouchDB comes with a developer-friendly query language, and optionally MapReduce for simple, efficient, and comprehensive data retrieval.\n\n### Operator for Apache CouchDB Features\n* Fully automated deployment and configuration of Apache CouchDB clusters.\n* Support single, multiple, or all namespace install modes.\n\n#### Security\n* TLS - TLS  is supported using Red Hat Service certificates or user-provided certificates.\n* Authentication - The parameter `require_valid_user` defaults to `true`, which means that no requests are allowed from anonymous users. Every request must be authenticated.\n* Authorization - Databases are initially accessible by Apache CouchDB admins only.\n\n#### High Availability\n* Nodes - Each database node in an Apache CouchDB cluster requires its own Kubernetes node. It's recommended that you run it with a minimum of three nodes for any production deployment.\n* Zones - The Apache CouchDB cluster database nodes are spread across available Kubernetes fault zones where available.\n* Replicas - The default configuration for each database is two shards (Q=2) and three shard copies (N=3), where each shard copy is deployed on a separate node in the cluster.\n\n### Reading and writing to Apache CouchDB\n\nThe Operator for Apache CouchDB automatically generates a Service. This can be accessed using port-forwarding e.g. `kubectl port-forward svc/my-couchdb-cluster 443:443 -u admin:mypassword`. Alternatively, configure an OpenShift Route to expose the service externally.\n\n### CouchDB 2.3.1 Update Instructions\nWhen the operator is updated to v2.0 or above any existing CouchDB 2.3.1 cluster will not be automatically upgraded to CouchDB 3. The user must manually trigger this process by removing the version statement `version: 2.3.1` in the CouchDBCluster CR for each CouchDB cluster\nThe operator will then perform a rolling update, with the new pods running CouchDB3.\nIt is advised that customers do this straightaway as CouchDB 2.3.1 is no longer supported.\n\n[Read the complete guide to using the Operator for Apache CouchDB](https://ibm.biz/BdfGQy)\n",

Linear scalability and\nproven fault-tolerance on commodity hardware or cloud infrastructure make it the\nperfect platform for mission-critical data. Cassandra's support for replicating\nacross multiple datacenters is best-in-class, providing lower latency for your\nusers and the peace of mind of knowing that you can survive regional outages.\n\n## DataStax Enterprise\n\nThe most advanced distribution of Apache Cassandra\u2122 on the market, with the\nenterprise functionality needed for serious production systems and backed up and\nsupported by the best distributed-experts in the world. It's one platform for\nall types of applications anywhere, any cloud, any model: key-value, graph,\ntabular, JSON.\n\nDataStax Enterprise is a fully integrated and optimized database, with graph,\nanalytics, and search included, all with a unified security model. Simply put,\nit's the only database capable of meeting today's demanding requirements\n\n## Operator Details\n\n`cass-operator` is designed as a modular operator for Apache Cassandra and\nderived  distributions. Apache Cassandra is a distributed database consisting of\nmultiple nodes working in concert to store data and process queries along a\nnumber of fault domains. `cass-operator` has the deployment of a Cassandra\ncluster around the logical domain of a datacenter with the `CassandraDatacenter`\ncustom resource.\n    \nUpon submission of one of these resources it handles provisioning the underlying\nstateful sets (analogous to C\\* logical racks), services, and configuration.\nAdditionally through monitoring pod state via Kubernetes callbacks it handles day to day\noperations such as restarting failed processes, scaling clusters up, and deploying\nconfiguration changes in a rolling, non-disruptive, fashion.\n    \nThis operator is designed to be `Namespace` scoped. A single Kubernetes cluster may\nbe running multiple instances of this operator, in separate namespaces, to support\na number of C\\* clusters and environments. Configuration is simple with the usage of\nYAML based overrides in the Custom Resource paired with an `init` container.\n    \nIn C\\* clusters ordering and timing of certain operations are important to keep the system\nevenly distributed. `cass-operator` takes advantage of a sidecar process within the\nmain container to handle the orchestration of starting our main C* process.",

Your web- and native applications love CouchDB, because it speaks JSON natively and supports binary data for all your data storage needs.\n\nThe [Couch Replication Protocol](http://docs.couchdb.org/en/master/replication/protocol.html) lets your data flow seamlessly between server clusters to mobile phones and web browsers, enabling a compelling [offline-first](http://offlinefirst.org/) user-experience while maintaining high performance and strong reliability. CouchDB comes with a developer-friendly query language, and optionally MapReduce for simple, efficient, and comprehensive data retrieval.\n\n### Operator for Apache CouchDB Features\n* Fully automated deployment and configuration of Apache CouchDB clusters.\n* Support single, multiple, or all namespace install modes.\n\n#### Security\n* TLS - TLS  is supported using Red Hat Service certificates or user-provided certificates.\n* Authentication - The parameter `require_valid_user` defaults to `true`, which means that no requests are allowed from anonymous users. Every request must be authenticated.\n* Authorization - Databases are initially accessible by Apache CouchDB admins only.\n\n#### High Availability\n* Nodes - Each database node in an Apache CouchDB cluster requires its own Kubernetes node. It's recommended that you run it with a minimum of three nodes for any production deployment.\n* Zones - The Apache CouchDB cluster database nodes are spread across available Kubernetes fault zones where available.\n* Replicas - The default configuration for each database is two shards (Q=2) and three shard copies (N=3), where each shard copy is deployed on a separate node in the cluster.\n\n### Reading and writing to Apache CouchDB\n\nThe Operator for Apache CouchDB automatically generates a Service. This can be accessed using port-forwarding e.g. `kubectl port-forward svc/my-couchdb-cluster 443:443 -u admin:mypassword`. Alternatively, configure an OpenShift Route to expose the service externally.\n\n### CouchDB 2.3.1 Update Instructions\nWhen the operator is updated to v2.0 or above any existing CouchDB 2.3.1 cluster will not be automatically upgraded to CouchDB 3. The user must manually trigger this process by removing the version statement `version: 2.3.1` in the CouchDBCluster CR for each CouchDB cluster\nThe operator will then perform a rolling update, with the new pods running CouchDB3.\nIt is advised that customers do this straightaway as CouchDB 2.3.1 is no longer supported.\n\n[Read the complete guide to using the Operator for Apache CouchDB](https://ibm.biz/BdfGQy)\n",

The [Couch Replication Protocol](http://docs.couchdb.org/en/master/replication/protocol.html) is implemented in a variety of projects and products that span every imaginable computing environment from globally distributed server-clusters, over mobile phones to web browsers.\n\nStore your data safely, on your own servers, or with any leading cloud provider. Your web- and native applications love CouchDB, because it speaks JSON natively and supports binary data for all your data storage needs.\n\nThe [Couch Replication Protocol](http://docs.couchdb.org/en/master/replication/protocol.html) lets your data flow seamlessly between server clusters to mobile phones and web browsers, enabling a compelling [offline-first](http://offlinefirst.org/) user-experience while maintaining high performance and strong reliability. CouchDB comes with a developer-friendly query language, and optionally MapReduce for simple, efficient, and comprehensive data retrieval.\n\n### Operator for Apache CouchDB Features\n* Fully automated deployment and configuration of Apache CouchDB clusters.\n* Support single, multiple, or all namespace install modes.\n\n#### Security\n* TLS - TLS  is supported using Red Hat Service certificates or user-provided certificates.\n* Authentication - The parameter `require_valid_user` defaults to `true`, which means that no requests are allowed from anonymous users. Every request must be authenticated.\n* Authorization - Databases are initially accessible by Apache CouchDB admins only.\n\n#### High Availability\n* Nodes - Each database node in an Apache CouchDB cluster requires its own Kubernetes node. It's recommended that you run it with a minimum of three nodes for any production deployment.\n* Zones - The Apache CouchDB cluster database nodes are spread across available Kubernetes fault zones where available.\n* Replicas - The default configuration for each database is two shards (Q=2) and three shard copies (N=3), where each shard copy is deployed on a separate node in the cluster.\n\n### Reading and writing to Apache CouchDB\n\nThe Operator for Apache CouchDB automatically generates a Service. This can be accessed using port-forwarding e.g. `kubectl port-forward svc/my-couchdb-cluster 443:443 -u admin:mypassword`. Alternatively, configure an OpenShift Route to expose the service externally.\n\n### CouchDB 2.3.1 Update Instructions\nWhen the operator is updated to v2.0 or above any existing CouchDB 2.3.1 cluster will not be automatically upgraded to CouchDB 3. The user must manually trigger this process by removing the version statement `version: 2.3.1` in the CouchDBCluster CR for each CouchDB cluster\nThe operator will then perform a rolling update, with the new pods running CouchDB3.\nIt is advised that customers do this straightaway as CouchDB 2.3.1 is no longer supported.\n\n[Read the complete guide to using the Operator for Apache CouchDB](https://ibm.biz/BdfGQy)\n",

      "csv_description": "# Instana\n\nInstana is an [APM solution](https://www.instana.com/product-overview/) built for microservices that enables IT Ops to build applications faster and deliver higher quality services by automating monitoring, tracing and root cause analysis. The solution is optimized for [Kubernetes](https://www.instana.com/automatic-kubernetes-monitoring/) and [OpenShift](https://www.instana.com/blog/automatic-root-cause-analysis-for-openshift-applications/).\n\n## Instana Agent Operator\n\nThis is the Kubernetes Operator for installing the Instana Agent on Kubernetes or OpenShift.\n\n## Prerequisites for OpenShift\n\nBefore the agent will be able to run in OpenShift, you need to perform a couple of extra configuration steps.\n\nYou need to set up a project for the Instana Agent and configure it's permissions.\n\nThe project you create here needs to be the namespace where you create the Instana Agent custom resource that the operator will use to deploy the agent.\n\nFor example, create the `instana-agent` project:\n\n    oc new-project instana-agent\n\nThen, ensure the `instana-agent` service account is in the privileged security context:\n\n    oc adm policy add-scc-to-user privileged -z instana-agent\n\nThis service account will be created by the operator.\n\nNow you can proceed with installing the operator for the Instana agent.\n\n## Installation and Configuration\n\nFirst, install this operator from [OperatorHub.io](https://operatorhub.io/), [OpenShift Container Platform](https://www.openshift.com/), or [OKD](https://www.okd.io/).\n\nSecond, create a custom resource with the agent configuration in the target namespace (for now, this MUST always be the `instana-agent` namespace). The operator will pick up the custom resource and install the Instana agent accordingly.\n\nThe following is a minimal template of the custom resource:\n\n```yaml\napiVersion: instana.io/v1\nkind: InstanaAgent\nmetadata:\n  name: instana-agent\n  namespace: instana-agent\nspec:\n  zone:\n    name: my-zone # (optional) name of the zone of the host\n  cluster:\n    name: replace-me # replace with the name of your Kubernetes cluster\n  agent:\n    key: replace-me # replace with your Instana agent key\n    endpointHost: ingress-red-saas.instana.io # the monitoring ingress endpoint\n    endpointPort: \"443\" # the monitoring ingress endpoint port, wrapped in quotes\n    env:\n      INSTANA_AGENT_TAGS: example\n    configuration_yaml: |\n      # You can leave this empty, or use this to configure your instana agent.\n      # See https://docs.instana.io/setup_and_manage/host_agent/on/kubernetes/\n```\n\nSave the template in a file `instana-agent.yaml` and edit the following values:\n\n* If your target namespace is not `instana-agent`, replace the `namespace:` accordingly.\n* `agent.key` must be set with your Instana agent key.\n* `agent.endpointHost` must be set with the monitoring ingress endpoint, generally either `saas-us-west-2.instana.io` or `saas-eu-west-1.instana.io`.\n* `agent.endpointPort` must be set with the monitoring ingress port, generally \"443\" (wrapped in quotes).\n* `zone.name` should be set with the name of the Kubernetes cluster that is be displayed in Instana.\n\nFor advanced configuration, you can edit the contents of the `configuration.yaml` file. View documentation [here](https://docs.instana.io/setup_and_manage/host_agent/on/kubernetes/).\n\nApply the custom resource with `kubectl apply -f instana-agent.yaml`. After some time, you should see `instana-agent` Pods being created on each node of your cluster, and your cluster should show on the infrastructure map on your Instana Web interface.\n\n## Uninstalling\n\nIn order to uninstall the Instana agent, simply remove the custom resource with `kubectl delete -f instana-agent.yaml`.\n\n## Source Code\n\nThe Instana agent operator is an open source project hosted on [https://github.com/instana/instana-agent-operator](https://github.com/instana/instana-agent-operator/).\n",

Pachyderm uses an object store to store your data. Set the pachd storage backend at `pachyderm.spec.pachd.storage.backend` to `AMAZON`, `MICROSOFT`, `GOOGLE` or `MINIO` depending on your storage provider. Additionally, create a user with read/write access to the object store.\n\n2. Setup the user credentials in the section, `pachyderm.spec.pachd.storage`. Required fields depend on the backend type set in step 1 above.\n\n3. Finally, deploy the pachyderm cluster in its own namespace.\n\nFor more information on getting started, reference the documentation.\n",

Pachyderm provides industry leading data versioning, pipelines and lineage that allow data science teams to automate the machine learning lifecycle and optimize their machine learning operations (MLOps). \n\n## Getting started\n\n1. Pachyderm uses an object store to store your data. Set the pachd storage backend at `pachyderm.spec.pachd.storage.backend` to `AMAZON`, `MICROSOFT`, `GOOGLE` or `MINIO` depending on your storage provider. Additionally, create a user with read/write access to the object store.\n\n2. Setup the user credentials in the section, `pachyderm.spec.pachd.storage`. Required fields depend on the backend type set in step 1 above.\n\n3. Finally, deploy the pachyderm cluster in its own namespace.\n\nFor more information on getting started, reference the documentation.\n",

Pachyderm provides industry leading data versioning, pipelines and lineage that allow data science teams to automate the machine learning lifecycle and optimize their machine learning operations (MLOps). \n\n## Getting started\n\n1. Pachyderm uses an object store to store your data. Set the pachd storage backend at `pachyderm.spec.pachd.storage.backend` to `AMAZON`, `MICROSOFT`, `GOOGLE` or `MINIO` depending on your storage provider. Additionally, create a user with read/write access to the object store.\n\n2. Setup the user credentials in the section, `pachyderm.spec.pachd.storage`. Required fields depend on the backend type set in step 1 above.\n\n3. Finally, deploy the pachyderm cluster in its own namespace.\n\nFor more information on getting started, reference the documentation.\n",

Pachyderm uses an object store to store your data. Set the pachd storage backend at `pachyderm.spec.pachd.storage.backend` to `AMAZON`, `MICROSOFT`, `GOOGLE` or `MINIO` depending on your storage provider. Additionally, create a user with read/write access to the object store.\n\n2. Setup the user credentials in the section, `pachyderm.spec.pachd.storage`. Required fields depend on the backend type set in step 1 above.\n\n3. Finally, deploy the pachyderm cluster in its own namespace.\n\nFor more information on getting started, reference the documentation.\n",

      "csv_description": "# Instana\n\nInstana is an [APM solution](https://www.instana.com/product-overview/) built for microservices that enables IT Ops to build applications faster and deliver higher quality services by automating monitoring, tracing and root cause analysis. The solution is optimized for [Kubernetes](https://www.instana.com/automatic-kubernetes-monitoring/) and [OpenShift](https://www.instana.com/blog/automatic-root-cause-analysis-for-openshift-applications/).\n\n## Instana Agent Operator\n\nThis is the Kubernetes Operator for installing the Instana Agent on Kubernetes or OpenShift.\n\n## Prerequisites for OpenShift\n\nBefore the agent will be able to run in OpenShift, you need to perform a couple of extra configuration steps.\n\nYou need to set up a project for the Instana Agent and configure it's permissions.\n\nThe project you create here needs to be the namespace where you create the Instana Agent custom resource that the operator will use to deploy the agent.\n\nFor example, create the `instana-agent` project:\n\n    oc new-project instana-agent\n\nThen, ensure the `instana-agent` service account is in the privileged security context:\n\n    oc adm policy add-scc-to-user privileged -z instana-agent\n\nThis service account will be created by the operator.\n\nNow you can proceed with installing the operator for the Instana agent.\n\n## Installation and Configuration\n\nFirst, install this operator from [OperatorHub.io](https://operatorhub.io/), [OpenShift Container Platform](https://www.openshift.com/), or [OKD](https://www.okd.io/).\n\nSecond, create a custom resource with the agent configuration in the target namespace (for now, this MUST always be the `instana-agent` namespace). The operator will pick up the custom resource and install the Instana agent accordingly.\n\nThe following is a minimal template of the custom resource:\n\n```yaml\napiVersion: instana.io/v1\nkind: InstanaAgent\nmetadata:\n  name: instana-agent\n  namespace: instana-agent\nspec:\n  zone:\n    name: my-zone # (optional) name of the zone of the host\n  cluster:\n    name: replace-me # replace with the name of your Kubernetes cluster\n  agent:\n    key: replace-me # replace with your Instana agent key\n    endpointHost: ingress-red-saas.instana.io # the monitoring ingress endpoint\n    endpointPort: \"443\" # the monitoring ingress endpoint port, wrapped in quotes\n    env:\n      INSTANA_AGENT_TAGS: example\n    configuration_yaml: |\n      # You can leave this empty, or use this to configure your instana agent.\n      # See https://docs.instana.io/setup_and_manage/host_agent/on/kubernetes/\n```\n\nSave the template in a file `instana-agent.yaml` and edit the following values:\n\n* If your target namespace is not `instana-agent`, replace the `namespace:` accordingly.\n* `agent.key` must be set with your Instana agent key.\n* `agent.endpointHost` must be set with the monitoring ingress endpoint, generally either `saas-us-west-2.instana.io` or `saas-eu-west-1.instana.io`.\n* `agent.endpointPort` must be set with the monitoring ingress port, generally \"443\" (wrapped in quotes).\n* `zone.name` should be set with the name of the Kubernetes cluster that is be displayed in Instana.\n\nFor advanced configuration, you can edit the contents of the `configuration.yaml` file. View documentation [here](https://docs.instana.io/setup_and_manage/host_agent/on/kubernetes/).\n\nApply the custom resource with `kubectl apply -f instana-agent.yaml`. After some time, you should see `instana-agent` Pods being created on each node of your cluster, and your cluster should show on the infrastructure map on your Instana Web interface.\n\n## Uninstalling\n\nIn order to uninstall the Instana agent, simply remove the custom resource with `kubectl delete -f instana-agent.yaml`.\n\n## Source Code\n\nThe Instana agent operator is an open source project hosted on [https://github.com/instana/instana-agent-operator](https://github.com/instana/instana-agent-operator/).\n",

MANTA performs code scanning for lineage that is illustrated to the detailed attribute level with transformations.   Extreme color coding and filtering to make lineage consumable.  Also includes time-slicing for historical lineage analysis.\n\n## Features\n* **Create/Destroy**: Launch MANTA Flow Container deployment.\n* **Scaling to zero**: Scale down the deployment (turn off the container).\n\n## Prerequisites and Requirements\n### MANTA Flow Namespace\nMANTA should be installed into its own namespace.\n\nFor additional installation documentation see a [MANTA Flow Container documentation](https://mantatools.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/MTKB/pages/2450620467/MANTA+Flow+Container)\nin the MANTA Flow Knowledge Base.\n\n### MANTA Flow Operator\nThe MANTA Flow Operator is responsible for deployment and management of MANTA Flow container deployment.\n\n### Memory Considerations\nMANTA Flow is a memory intensive application. The MANTA Flow Container will specify the memory and cpu requirements for both request and limits. Also, the minimum storage requirements are specified for the persistent volumes (PVs).\n\n### MANTA Flow license.key\nValid license.key needs to be provided in order to successfully launch MANTA Flow Container.\n\n## MANTA Flow Deployment\n\n### Secrets\nCreate a secret for MANTA Flow license.key by:\n    \n    oc create secret generic mantaflow-keys --from-file=<path to license.key>/license.key\n\nCreate an initial admin credentials `username` and `password` and a MANTA master password, which is used for encryption of sensitive data in the persistent storage.\n\n    oc create secret generic mantaflow-credentials --from-literal=username=<manta admin username> --from-literal=password=<manta admin password> --from-literal=MANTA_MASTERPASSWORD=<password for encryption>\n\n### Create MANTA Auth Custom Resource\nCreate a MANTA Auth custom resource. Please use the default parameters provided by the operator and the name of the keys above.\n\n### Create MANTA Flow Custom Resource\nCreate a MANTA Flow custom resource. Please use the default parameters provided by the operator and the name of the keys above.\n\n## Scaling\nMANTA Flow currently supports scaling to zero. This means you can set `replicas: 0` in MANTA Flow Custom Resource Definition (CRD) and MANTA Flow container will be stopped.\n\nBy setting `replicas: 1` MANTA Flow will be scaled to be running on 1 container. All other values of `replicas` are considered invalid.\n",

      "csv_description": "The Dynatrace Operator supports rollout and lifecycle management of various Dynatrace components in Kubernetes and OpenShift.\n\nCurrently the Dynatrace Operator supports the following capabilities:\n\n### OneAgent\n  * `classicFullStack` rolls out one OneAgent pod per node to monitor its pods and the node itself\n  * `applicationMonitoring` is a webhook based injection mechanism for automatic app-only injection\n  * `hostMonitoring` monitors only the hosts, i.e., the nodes, in the cluster without app-only injection\n### ActiveGate\n  * `routing` routes OneAgent traffic through the ActiveGate\n  * `kubernetes-monitoring` allows monitoring the Kubernetes API\n  * `metrics-ingest` routes enriched metrics through an ActiveGate\n\nFor more information please refer to [our DynaKube Custom Resource examples](https://dt-url.net/dynakube-samples).\n\n### Installation\nOnce you've installed the Dynatrace Operator, you can create a DynaKube custom resource.\n\nFirst, please add a Secret within the Project you've deployed the Dynatrace Operator to, which would contain your API and PaaS tokens. Create tokens of type *Dynatrace API* (`API_TOKEN`) and *Platform as a Service* (`PAAS_TOKEN`) and use their values in the following commands respectively.\n\nFor assistance please refer to [Create user-generated access tokens](https://www.dynatrace.com/support/help/shortlink/token#create-user-generated-access-tokens).\n\n``` $ oc -n <project> create secret generic dynakube --from-literal=\"apiToken=API_TOKEN\" --from-literal=\"paasToken=PAAS_TOKEN\" ```\n\nYou may update this Secret at any time to rotate the tokens.\n\nAfter creation of the secret add the DynaKube object in the project where the Dynatrace Operator has been deployed, configured to your needs.\n\n### Required Parameters\n* `apiUrl` - provide the URL to the API of your Dynatrace environment. In Dynatrace SaaS it will look like `https://<ENVIRONMENTID>.live.dynatrace.com/api` . In Dynatrace Managed like `https://<YourDynatraceServerURL>/e/<ENVIRONMENTID>/api` .\n\n### Advanced Options\n* **Disable Certificate Checking** - disable any certificate validation that may interact poorly with proxies with in your cluster\n* **Image Override** - use a copy of the ActiveGate container image from a registry other than Docker's or Red Hat's\n\nFor a complete list of supported parameters please consult the [Operator Deploy Guide](https://www.dynatrace.com/support/help/shortlink/openshift-deploy).\n\n### Help\nYou can find more about our instructions in our [documentation](https://www.dynatrace.com/support/help/shortlink/openshift-deploy#install-dynatrace-operator).\n",

The version of Rabbitmq that this chart uses has significantly changed from version 1.1.8 of the operator.\nFor full details on how to migrate please visit:\n`https://github.com/jfrog/charts/blob/master/stable/xray/RABBITMQ_MIGRATION_NOTES.md`\n### Security Context Constraints\nTo deploy this helm chart you will need to be a cluster admin w/ access to the anyuid scc and add the operator service account to the anyuid scc.\n\n```\noc adm policy add-scc-to-user anyuid -z xray-operator\n```\n```\noc adm policy add-scc-to-user anyuid -z openshiftxray\n```\n```\noc adm policy add-scc-to-user anyuid -z openshiftxray-rabbitmq-ha\n```\n\n## Usage\n\nAn external DB is required. The operator will not deploy a DB but will require you to specify the configuration values to connect to it.\n\nSearch for JFrog and click JFrog Xray Operator to install.\n\nGo to the Installed Operators.\n\nWait for the JFrog Xray Operator to complete the installation.\n\nOpen the Operator and click on the provided API: Xray\n\nClick Create New Instance and provide the following parameters for your DB configuration:\n\n```\nJFROG_URL\nDATABASE_URL\nDATABASE_USER\nDATABASE_PASSWORD\n```\n\nJFROG_URL is the external ip or DNS of your Artifactory to connect Xray to. Artifactory is required to use this operator.\nYou can set your JFROG_URL to the service name of your Artifactory Nginx:\n``` oc get svc -n my_namespace | grep nginx ```\nDATABASE_URL must be a Postgresql URL in the format:\n``\npostgres://postgres-postgresql:5432/xraydb?sslmode=disable\n``\nDATABASE_USER and DATABASE_PASSWORD must supply a valid user on Postgresql.\n\nClick Create for Xray to deploy into OpenShift.\n\nOpen Artifactory in a web browser to complete the onboarding wizard for Xray!\n\n### Air gap environments\n\nTo use Xray Operator in an air gap environment you will need to download the images as image streams into your Openshift air gap cluster manually.\n\nUse the image overrides to then specify the image stream locations that are local to your cluster.\n\nNext you will need to setup the database of index data for xray to use when scanning artifacts.\n\nFollow the link below for instructions on setup:\n\nhttps://www.jfrog.com/confluence/display/JFROG/Configuring+Xray#ConfiguringXray-SynchronizingtheDatabase\n\n",

      "csv_description": "The Couchbase Autonomous Operator allows users to easily deploy, manage, and maintain Couchbase deployments on OpenShift. By installing this integration you will be able to deply Couchbase Server clusters with a single command.\n\n## Supported Features\n\n* **Automated cluster provisioning** - Deploying a Couchbase Cluster has never been easier. Fill out a Couchbase specific configuration and let the Couchbase Operator take care of provisioning nodes and setting up cluster to your exact specification.\n\n* **On-demand scalability** - Automatically scale your cluster up or down by changing a simple configuration parameter and let the Couchbase Operator handle provisioning of new nodes and joining them into the cluster.\n\n* **Auto-recovery** - Detect Couchbase node failures, rebalance out bad nodes, and bring the cluster back up to the desired capacity. Auto-recovery is completely automated so you can sleep easy through the night knowing that the Couchbase Operator will handle any failures.\n\n* **Geo-distribution** - Replicate your data between datacenters to move data closer to the users who consume it and protect against disaster scenarios where an entire datacenter becomes unavailable.\n\n* **Persistent storage** - Define persistent network-attached storage for each node in your cluster to allow pods to be recovered even if the node they were running on is no longer available.\n\n* **Rack/zone awareness** - Tell the Couchbase Operator about availability zones in your datacenter and let the operator take care of ensuring that nodes in your cluster are deployed equally across each zone.\n\n* **Supportability** - When things go wrong, use the cbopinfo tool provided with the Couchbase Operator to collect relevant data about your Couchbase deployment so that you can quickly address issues.\n\n* **Centralized configuration management** - Manage your configuration centrally with OpenShift. Updates to the configuration are watched by the Couchbase Operator and actions are taken to make the target cluster match the desired configuration.\n## Required Parameters\n* `authSecret` - provide the name of a secret that contains two keys for the `username` and `password` of the super user ([documentation](https://docs.couchbase.com/operator/1.2/couchbase-cluster-config.html))\n\n## About Couchbase Server\n\nBuilt on the most powerful NoSQL technology, Couchbase Server delivers unparalleled performance at scale, in any cloud. With features like memory-first architecture, geo-distributed deployments, and workload isolation, Couchbase Server excels at supporting mission-critical applications at scale while maintaining submillisecond latencies and 99.999% availability. Plus, with the most comprehensive SQL-compatible query language (N1QL), migrating from RDBMS to Couchbase Server is easy with ANSI joins.\n",

      "csv_description": "The Couchbase Autonomous Operator allows users to easily deploy, manage, and maintain Couchbase deployments on OpenShift. By installing this integration you will be able to deply Couchbase Server clusters with a single command.\n\n## Supported Features\n\n* **Automated cluster provisioning** - Deploying a Couchbase Cluster has never been easier. Fill out a Couchbase specific configuration and let the Couchbase Operator take care of provisioning nodes and setting up cluster to your exact specification.\n\n* **On-demand scalability** - Automatically scale your cluster up or down by changing a simple configuration parameter and let the Couchbase Operator handle provisioning of new nodes and joining them into the cluster.\n\n* **Auto-recovery** - Detect Couchbase node failures, rebalance out bad nodes, and bring the cluster back up to the desired capacity. Auto-recovery is completely automated so you can sleep easy through the night knowing that the Couchbase Operator will handle any failures.\n\n* **Geo-distribution** - Replicate your data between datacenters to move data closer to the users who consume it and protect against disaster scenarios where an entire datacenter becomes unavailable.\n\n* **Persistent storage** - Define persistent network-attached storage for each node in your cluster to allow pods to be recovered even if the node they were running on is no longer available.\n\n* **Rack/zone awareness** - Tell the Couchbase Operator about availability zones in your datacenter and let the operator take care of ensuring that nodes in your cluster are deployed equally across each zone.\n\n* **Supportability** - When things go wrong, use the cbopinfo tool provided with the Couchbase Operator to collect relevant data about your Couchbase deployment so that you can quickly address issues.\n\n* **Centralized configuration management** - Manage your configuration centrally with OpenShift. Updates to the configuration are watched by the Couchbase Operator and actions are taken to make the target cluster match the desired configuration.\n## Required Parameters\n* `authSecret` - provide the name of a secret that contains two keys for the `username` and `password` of the super user ([documentation](https://docs.couchbase.com/operator/1.2/couchbase-cluster-config.html))\n\n## About Couchbase Server\n\nBuilt on the most powerful NoSQL technology, Couchbase Server delivers unparalleled performance at scale, in any cloud. With features like memory-first architecture, geo-distributed deployments, and workload isolation, Couchbase Server excels at supporting mission-critical applications at scale while maintaining submillisecond latencies and 99.999% availability. Plus, with the most comprehensive SQL-compatible query language (N1QL), migrating from RDBMS to Couchbase Server is easy with ANSI joins.\n",

      "csv_description": "The Couchbase Autonomous Operator allows users to easily deploy, manage, and maintain Couchbase deployments on OpenShift. By installing this integration you will be able to deply Couchbase Server clusters with a single command.\n\n## Supported Features\n\n* **Automated cluster provisioning** - Deploying a Couchbase Cluster has never been easier. Fill out a Couchbase specific configuration and let the Couchbase Operator take care of provisioning nodes and setting up cluster to your exact specification.\n\n* **On-demand scalability** - Automatically scale your cluster up or down by changing a simple configuration parameter and let the Couchbase Operator handle provisioning of new nodes and joining them into the cluster.\n\n* **Auto-recovery** - Detect Couchbase node failures, rebalance out bad nodes, and bring the cluster back up to the desired capacity. Auto-recovery is completely automated so you can sleep easy through the night knowing that the Couchbase Operator will handle any failures.\n\n* **Geo-distribution** - Replicate your data between datacenters to move data closer to the users who consume it and protect against disaster scenarios where an entire datacenter becomes unavailable.\n\n* **Persistent storage** - Define persistent network-attached storage for each node in your cluster to allow pods to be recovered even if the node they were running on is no longer available.\n\n* **Rack/zone awareness** - Tell the Couchbase Operator about availability zones in your datacenter and let the operator take care of ensuring that nodes in your cluster are deployed equally across each zone.\n\n* **Supportability** - When things go wrong, use the cbopinfo tool provided with the Couchbase Operator to collect relevant data about your Couchbase deployment so that you can quickly address issues.\n\n* **Centralized configuration management** - Manage your configuration centrally with OpenShift. Updates to the configuration are watched by the Couchbase Operator and actions are taken to make the target cluster match the desired configuration.\n## Required Parameters\n* `authSecret` - provide the name of a secret that contains two keys for the `username` and `password` of the super user ([documentation](https://docs.couchbase.com/operator/1.2/couchbase-cluster-config.html))\n\n## About Couchbase Server\n\nBuilt on the most powerful NoSQL technology, Couchbase Server delivers unparalleled performance at scale, in any cloud. With features like memory-first architecture, geo-distributed deployments, and workload isolation, Couchbase Server excels at supporting mission-critical applications at scale while maintaining submillisecond latencies and 99.999% availability. Plus, with the most comprehensive SQL-compatible query language (N1QL), migrating from RDBMS to Couchbase Server is easy with ANSI joins.\n",

The server provides an inference service via gRPC or REST API - making it easy to deploy new algorithms and AI experiments using the same architecture as [TensorFlow Serving](https://github.com/tensorflow/serving) for any models trained in a framework that is supported by [OpenVINO](https://software.intel.com/en-us/openvino-toolkit).\nModel Server configuration is identical with a [Helm chart](https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/model_server/tree/main/deploy) for OVMS. It supports all the parameters from the helm chart.\n## Using the cluster\nOpenVINO Model Server can be consumed as a `Service`. It is called like with `ModelServer` resource with `-ovms` suffix.\nThe suffix is ommited when `ovms` phrase is included in the name.\nThe service exposes gRPC and REST API interfaces to run inference requests.\n```\noc get pods\nNAME                                        READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE\nmodel-server-sample-ovms-586f6f76df-dpps4   1/1     Running   0          8h\n\noc get services\nNAME                       TYPE        CLUSTER-IP       EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)             AGE\nmodel-server-sample-ovms   ClusterIP   172.25.199.210   <none>        8080/TCP,8081/TCP   8h\n```\n## Before you start\nDepending on the deployment configuration there might be pre-requisites for additional records to be created in the cluster. \n## References\nOpenVINO Model Server on [Github](https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/model_server/tree/main/extras/openvino-operator-openshift)\n\n# Notebook\nThe Notebook resource integrates JupyterHub from OpenShift Data Science or Open Data Hub with a container image that includes [developer\ntools](https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/openvino/blob/master/docs/install_guides/pypi-openvino-dev.md)\nfrom the OpenVINO toolkit and a set of Jupyter notebook tutorials. It enables selecting a defined image `openvino-notebook` from\nthe Jupyter Spawner drop-down menu.\n\nCreate the `Notebook` resource in the same project with JupyterHub and RedHat OpenShift Data Science operator.\nIt builds the image in the cluster based on Dockerfile from [openvino_notebooks](https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/openvino_notebooks).\n",

      "csv_description": "Zettaset\u2019s RedHat Certified XCrypt Operator allows users to deploy multiple XCrypt components on OpenShift with just a few simple commands. The XCrypt Operator deployment provides software-defined encryption that transparently protects container data throughout your OpenShift environment.\n\n## Core Features\n* **Automated XCrypt provisioning** - Deploying a Zettaset XCrypt has never been easier. Adjust cluster specific configuration and let the Zettaset Operator take care of provisioning XCrypt services and setting up the XCrypt encryption to your exact specification. \n* **CSI Driver deployment**: Zettaset XCrypt Operator automatically deploys Zettaset XCrypt CSI Driver in order to provide automated and transparent data-at-rest  encryption functionality compatible with Openshift and any other container orchestrator. Once the Operator is provisioned, the driver runs fine tuned and ready to work with other XCrypt components.\n* **Multi-node topology**: Encrypt as many nodes and volumes as you need to. XCrypt components can be installed on multiple nodes across the cluster. This is defined by two labels: zts-master and zts-worker. Normally zts-master node is a single node that runs Zettaset XCrypt major services required for the product operation. Multiple nodes can be marked as zts-worker and those are the nodes that can have encrypted volumes.\n* **Seamless Encrypted Volume mount**: Volumes are not only being encrypted, but also are mounted/unmounted to containers with Persistent Volume Claims. This happens as seamlessly as regular volumes provision and mount/unmount.\n* **Robust failover**: A node failure doesn\u2019t affect XCrypt operations on other nodes of the cluster. Encryption on a restarted/recovered node gets back to normal functioning if the node stays healthy and data hasn\u2019t been corrupted during the restart\n\n## About Zettaset XCrypt Kubernetes Encryption for OpenShift\nXCrypt Kubernetes Encryption for OpenShift is a software-only solution that enables encryption of data at rest stored in Red Hat OpenShift container environments without slowing down the DevSecOps process.

      "csv_description": "This advanced Operator can be used to deploy and manage Open Liberty applications with consistent, production-grade QoS. This operator is based on the [Runtime Component Operator](https://github.com/application-stacks/runtime-component-operator) and provides all of its capabilities in addition to Open Liberty specific features such as gathering traces and dumps (Day-2 operations) and easily configuring and managing the single sign-on information for your Open Liberty applications.\n\nOpen Liberty Operator enables enterprise architects to govern the way their applications get deployed & managed in the cluster, while dramatically reducing the learning curve for developers to deploy into Kubernetes - allowing them to focus on writing the code! Here are some key features:\n\n#### Application Lifecyle\nYou can deploy your Open Liberty application container by either pointing to a container image, or an OpenShift ImageStream. When using an ImageStream the Operator will watch for any updates and will re-deploy the modified image.\n\n#### Custom RBAC\nThis Operator is capable of using a custom ServiceAccount from the caller, allowing it to follow RBAC restrictions. By default it creates a ServiceAccount if one is not specified, which can also be bound with specific roles.\n\n#### Environment Configuration\nYou can configure a variety of artifacts with your deployment, such as: labels, annotations, and environment variables from a ConfigMap, a Secret or a value.\n\n#### Routing\nExpose your application to external users via a single toggle to create a Route on OpenShift or an Ingress on other Kubernetes environments. Advanced configuration, such as TLS settings, are also easily enabled. Expiring Route certificates are re-issued.\n\n#### High Availability via Horizontal Pod Autoscaling\nRun multiple instances of your application for high availability. Either specify a static number of replicas or easily configure horizontal auto scaling to create (and delete) instances based on resource consumption.\n\n#### Persistence and advanced storage\nEnable persistence for your application by specifying simple requirements: just tell us the size of the storage and where you would like it to be mounted and We will create and manage that storage for you.\nThis toggles a StatefulSet resource instead of a Deployment resource, so your container can recover transactions and state upon a pod restart.\nWe offer an advanced mode where the user specifies a built-in PersistentVolumeClaim, allowing them to configure many details of the persistent volume, such as its storage class and access mode.\nYou can also easily configure and use a single storage for serviceability related Day-2 operations, such as gatherig server traces and dumps.\n\n#### Service Binding\nYour runtime components can expose services by a simple toggle. We take care of the heavy lifting such as creating kubernetes Secrets with information other services can use to bind. We also keep the bindable information synchronized, so your applications can dynamically reconnect to its required services without any intervention or interruption.\n\n#### Single Sign-On (SSO)\nOpen Liberty provides capabilities to delegate authentication to external providers. Your application users can log in using their existing social media credentials from providers such as Google, Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter, GitHub, and any OpenID Connect (OIDC) or OAuth 2.0 clients. Open Liberty Operator allows to easily configure and manage the single sign-on information for your applications.\n\n#### Exposing metrics to Prometheus\nThe Open Liberty Operator exposes the runtime container's metrics via the [Prometheus Operator](https://operatorhub.io/operator/prometheus).\nUsers can pick between a basic mode, where they simply specify the label that Prometheus is watching to scrape the metrics from the container, or they can specify the full `ServiceMonitor` spec embedded into the OpenLibertyApplication's `spec.monitoring` key controlling things like the poll internal and security credentials.\n\n#### Easily mount logs and transaction directories\nIf you need to mount the logs and transaction data from your application to an external volume such as NFS (or any storage supported in your cluster), simply add the following (customizing the folder location and size) to your OpenLibertyApplication CR:\n``` storage: size: 2Gi mountPath: \"/logs\" ```\n\n#### Integration with OpenShift Serverless\nDeploy your serverless runtime component using a single toggle.  The Operator will convert all of its generated resources into [Knative](https://knative.dev) resources, allowing your pod to automatically scale to 0 when it is idle.\n\n#### Integration with OpenShift's Topology UI\nWe set the corresponding labels to support OpenShift's Developer Topology UI, which allows you to visualize your entire set of deployments and how they are connected.\n\nSee our [**documentation**](https://github.com/OpenLiberty/open-liberty-operator/tree/main/doc/) for more information.\n",

The NeuVector operator contains all necessary information to deploy NeuVector using helm charts. You simply need to install the NeuVector operator from the OpenShift embeded operator hub and create NeuVector instance. You can modify the NeuVector installation configuration by modifying yaml while creating the NeuVector instance such as imagePullSecrets, tag version, etc. Please refer to [github link](https://github.com/neuvector/neuvector-helm/tree/master/charts/core) for the values that can be modifed during installation. To upgrade to a newer version of NeuVector, just reapply the NeuVector instance with desired tag , which in turn pulls the specified NeuVector image tags and upgrades as per upgrade plan configured on the helm chart.  NeuVector Operator versions are tied to NeuVector product versions. Version 1.2.8 of the NeuVector Certified Operator deploys version 4.3.1 of NeuVector.\n\n**Complete below steps to Grant Service Account Access to the Privileged SCC before installation.**\n\nCreate the NeuVector namespace\n\n         oc new-project  neuvector\nLogin as system:admin account\n\n         oc login -u system:admin\n\nGrant Service Account Access to the Privileged SCC\n\n         oc -n neuvector adm policy add-scc-to-user privileged -z default\n\nThe following info will be added in the Privileged SCC users:\n\n         - system:serviceaccount:neuvector:default\n\nIn OpenShift 4.6+ use the following to check:\n\n         oc get rolebinding system:openshift:scc:privileged -n neuvector -o wide\n         NAME                              ROLE                                          AGE     USERS   GROUPS   SERVICEACCOUNTS\n         system:openshift:scc:privileged   ClusterRole/system:openshift:scc:privileged   9m22s                    neuvector/default\n\n\n**Add NeuVector license from NeuVector WebUI->setting**\n\n\n#Deploying the NeuVector Operator#\n\n\nPlease refer to the instructions [here](https://github.com/neuvector/neuvector-operator/blob/master/README.md)\n\n\n",

The NeuVector operator contains all necessary information to deploy NeuVector using helm charts. You simply need to install the NeuVector operator from the OpenShift embeded operator hub and create NeuVector instance. You can modify the NeuVector installation configuration by modifying yaml while creating the NeuVector instance such as imagePullSecrets, tag version, etc. Please refer to [github link](https://github.com/neuvector/neuvector-helm/tree/master/charts/core) for the values that can be modifed during installation. To upgrade to a newer version of NeuVector, just reapply the NeuVector instance with desired tag , which in turn pulls the specified NeuVector image tags and upgrades as per upgrade plan configured on the helm chart.  NeuVector Operator versions are tied to NeuVector product versions. Version 1.2.9 of the NeuVector Certified Operator deploys version 4.3.1 of NeuVector.\n\n**Complete below steps to Grant Service Account Access to the Privileged SCC before installation.**\n\nCreate the NeuVector namespace\n\n         oc new-project  neuvector\nLogin as system:admin account\n\n         oc login -u system:admin\n\nGrant Service Account Access to the Privileged SCC\n\n         oc -n neuvector adm policy add-scc-to-user privileged -z default\n\nThe following info will be added in the Privileged SCC users:\n\n         - system:serviceaccount:neuvector:default\n\nIn OpenShift 4.6+ use the following to check:\n\n         oc get rolebinding system:openshift:scc:privileged -n neuvector -o wide\n         NAME                              ROLE                                          AGE     USERS   GROUPS   SERVICEACCOUNTS\n         system:openshift:scc:privileged   ClusterRole/system:openshift:scc:privileged   9m22s                    neuvector/default\n\n\n**Add NeuVector license from NeuVector WebUI->setting**\n\n\n#Deploying the NeuVector Operator#\n\n\nPlease refer to the instructions [here](https://github.com/neuvector/neuvector-operator/blob/master/README.md)\n\n\n",

The NeuVector operator contains all necessary information to deploy NeuVector using helm charts. You simply need to install the NeuVector operator from the OpenShift embeded operator hub and create NeuVector instance. You can modify the NeuVector installation configuration by modifying yaml while creating the NeuVector instance such as imagePullSecrets, tag version, etc. Please refer to [github link](https://github.com/neuvector/neuvector-helm/tree/master/charts/core) for the values that can be modifed during installation. To upgrade to a newer version of NeuVector, just reapply the NeuVector instance with desired tag , which in turn pulls the specified NeuVector image tags and upgrades as per upgrade plan configured on the helm chart.  NeuVector Operator versions are tied to NeuVector product versions. Version 1.3.0 of the NeuVector Certified Operator deploys version 4.3.2 of NeuVector.\n\n**Complete below steps to Grant Service Account Access to the Privileged SCC before installation.**\n\nCreate the NeuVector namespace\n\n         oc new-project  neuvector\nLogin as system:admin account\n\n         oc login -u system:admin\n\nGrant Service Account Access to the Privileged SCC\n\n         oc -n neuvector adm policy add-scc-to-user privileged -z default\n\nThe following info will be added in the Privileged SCC users:\n\n         - system:serviceaccount:neuvector:default\n\nIn OpenShift 4.6+ use the following to check:\n\n         oc get rolebinding system:openshift:scc:privileged -n neuvector -o wide\n         system:openshift:scc:privileged   ClusterRole/system:openshift:scc:privileged   9m22s                    neuvector/default\n\n\n**Add NeuVector license from NeuVector WebUI->setting**\n\n\n#Deploying the NeuVector Operator#\n\n\nPlease refer to the instructions [here](https://github.com/neuvector/neuvector-operator/blob/master/README.md)\n\n\n",

The NeuVector operator contains all necessary information to deploy NeuVector using helm charts. You simply need to install the NeuVector operator from the OpenShift embeded operator hub and create NeuVector instance. You can modify the NeuVector installation configuration by modifying yaml while creating the NeuVector instance such as imagePullSecrets, tag version, etc. Please refer to [github link](https://github.com/neuvector/neuvector-helm/tree/master/charts/core) for the values that can be modifed during installation. To upgrade to a newer version of NeuVector, just reapply the NeuVector instance with desired tag , which in turn pulls the specified NeuVector image tags and upgrades as per upgrade plan configured on the helm chart.  NeuVector Operator versions are tied to NeuVector product versions. Version 1.3.1 of the NeuVector Certified Operator deploys version 4.3.2-s1 of NeuVector.\n\n**Complete below steps to Grant Service Account Access to the Privileged SCC before installation.**\n\nCreate the NeuVector namespace\n\n         oc new-project  neuvector\nLogin as system:admin account\n\n         oc login -u system:admin\n\nGrant Service Account Access to the Privileged SCC\n\n         oc -n neuvector adm policy add-scc-to-user privileged -z default\n\nThe following info will be added in the Privileged SCC users:\n\n         - system:serviceaccount:neuvector:default\n\nIn OpenShift 4.6+ use the following to check:\n\n         oc get rolebinding system:openshift:scc:privileged -n neuvector -o wide\n         system:openshift:scc:privileged   ClusterRole/system:openshift:scc:privileged   9m22s                    neuvector/default\n\n\n**Add NeuVector license from NeuVector WebUI->setting**\n\n\n#Deploying the NeuVector Operator#\n\n\nPlease refer to the instructions [here](https://github.com/neuvector/neuvector-operator/blob/master/README.md)\n\n\n",

The NeuVector operator contains all necessary information to deploy NeuVector using helm charts. You simply need to install the NeuVector operator from the OpenShift embeded operator hub and create NeuVector instance. You can modify the NeuVector installation configuration by modifying yaml while creating the NeuVector instance such as imagePullSecrets, tag version, etc. Please refer to [github link](https://github.com/neuvector/neuvector-helm/tree/master/charts/core) for the values that can be modifed during installation. To upgrade to a newer version of NeuVector, just reapply the NeuVector instance with desired tag , which in turn pulls the specified NeuVector image tags and upgrades as per upgrade plan configured on the helm chart.  NeuVector Operator versions are tied to NeuVector product versions. Version 1.3.2 of the NeuVector Certified Operator deploys version 4.4.2 of NeuVector.\n\n**Complete below steps to Grant Service Account Access to the Privileged SCC before installation.**\n\nCreate the NeuVector namespace\n\n         oc new-project  neuvector\nLogin as system:admin account\n\n         oc login -u system:admin\n\nGrant Service Account Access to the Privileged SCC\n\n         oc -n neuvector adm policy add-scc-to-user privileged -z default\n\nThe following info will be added in the Privileged SCC users:\n\n         - system:serviceaccount:neuvector:default\n\nIn OpenShift 4.6+ use the following to check:\n\n         oc get rolebinding system:openshift:scc:privileged -n neuvector -o wide\n         system:openshift:scc:privileged   ClusterRole/system:openshift:scc:privileged   9m22s                    neuvector/default\n\n\n**Add NeuVector license from NeuVector WebUI->setting**\n\n\n#Deploying the NeuVector Operator#\n\n\nPlease refer to the instructions [here](https://github.com/neuvector/neuvector-operator/blob/master/README.md)\n\n\n",

The NeuVector operator contains all necessary information to deploy NeuVector using helm charts. You simply need to install the NeuVector operator from the OpenShift embeded operator hub and create NeuVector instance. You can modify the NeuVector installation configuration by modifying yaml while creating the NeuVector instance such as imagePullSecrets, tag version, etc. Please refer to [github link](https://github.com/neuvector/neuvector-helm/tree/master/charts/core) for the values that can be modifed during installation. To upgrade to a newer version of NeuVector, just reapply the NeuVector instance with desired tag , which in turn pulls the specified NeuVector image tags and upgrades as per upgrade plan configured on the helm chart.  NeuVector Operator versions are tied to NeuVector product versions. Version 1.3.3 of the NeuVector Certified Operator deploys version 4.4.3 of NeuVector.\n\n**Complete below steps to Grant Service Account Access to the Privileged SCC before installation.**\n\nCreate the NeuVector namespace\n\n         oc new-project  neuvector\nLogin as system:admin account\n\n         oc login -u system:admin\n\nGrant Service Account Access to the Privileged SCC\n\n         oc -n neuvector adm policy add-scc-to-user privileged -z default\n\nThe following info will be added in the Privileged SCC users:\n\n         - system:serviceaccount:neuvector:default\n\nIn OpenShift 4.6+ use the following to check:\n\n         oc get rolebinding system:openshift:scc:privileged -n neuvector -o wide\n         system:openshift:scc:privileged   ClusterRole/system:openshift:scc:privileged   9m22s                    neuvector/default\n\n\n**Add NeuVector license from NeuVector WebUI->setting**\n\n\n#Deploying the NeuVector Operator#\n\n\nPlease refer to the instructions [here](https://github.com/neuvector/neuvector-operator/blob/master/README.md)\n\n\n",

The NeuVector operator contains all necessary information to deploy NeuVector using helm charts. You simply need to install the NeuVector operator from the OpenShift embeded operator hub and create NeuVector instance. You can modify the NeuVector installation configuration by modifying yaml while creating the NeuVector instance such as imagePullSecrets, tag version, etc. Please refer to [github link](https://github.com/neuvector/neuvector-helm/tree/master/charts/core) for the values that can be modifed during installation. To upgrade to a newer version of NeuVector, just reapply the NeuVector instance with desired tag , which in turn pulls the specified NeuVector image tags and upgrades as per upgrade plan configured on the helm chart.  NeuVector Operator versions are tied to NeuVector product versions. Version 1.3.4 of the NeuVector Certified Operator deploys version 4.4.3 of NeuVector.\n\n**Complete below steps to Grant Service Account Access to the Privileged SCC before installation.**\n\nCreate the NeuVector namespace\n\n         oc new-project  neuvector\nLogin as system:admin account\n\n         oc login -u system:admin\n\nGrant Service Account Access to the Privileged SCC\n\n         oc -n neuvector adm policy add-scc-to-user privileged -z default\n\nThe following info will be added in the Privileged SCC users:\n\n         - system:serviceaccount:neuvector:default\n\nIn OpenShift 4.6+ use the following to check:\n\n         oc get rolebinding system:openshift:scc:privileged -n neuvector -o wide\n         system:openshift:scc:privileged   ClusterRole/system:openshift:scc:privileged   9m22s                    neuvector/default\n\n\n**Add NeuVector license from NeuVector WebUI->setting**\n\n\n#Deploying the NeuVector Operator#\n\n\nPlease refer to the instructions [here](https://github.com/neuvector/neuvector-operator/blob/master/README.md)\n\n\n",

The NeuVector operator contains all necessary information to deploy NeuVector using helm charts. You simply need to install the NeuVector operator from the OpenShift embeded operator hub and create NeuVector instance. You can modify the NeuVector installation configuration by modifying yaml while creating the NeuVector instance such as imagePullSecrets, tag version, etc. Please refer to [github link](https://github.com/neuvector/neuvector-helm/tree/master/charts/core) for the values that can be modifed during installation. To upgrade to a newer version of NeuVector, just reapply the NeuVector instance with desired tag , which in turn pulls the specified NeuVector image tags and upgrades as per upgrade plan configured on the helm chart.  NeuVector Operator versions are tied to NeuVector product versions. Version 1.3.5 of the NeuVector Certified Operator deploys version 4.4.4 of NeuVector.\n\n**Complete below steps to Grant Service Account Access to the Privileged SCC before installation.**\n\nCreate the NeuVector namespace\n\n         oc new-project  neuvector\nLogin as system:admin account\n\n         oc login -u system:admin\n\nGrant Service Account Access to the Privileged SCC\n\n         oc -n neuvector adm policy add-scc-to-user privileged -z default\n\nThe following info will be added in the Privileged SCC users:\n\n         - system:serviceaccount:neuvector:default\n\nIn OpenShift 4.6+ use the following to check:\n\n         oc get rolebinding system:openshift:scc:privileged -n neuvector -o wide\n         system:openshift:scc:privileged   ClusterRole/system:openshift:scc:privileged   9m22s                    neuvector/default\n\n\n**Add NeuVector license from NeuVector WebUI->setting**\n\n\n#Deploying the NeuVector Operator#\n\n\nPlease refer to the instructions [here](https://github.com/neuvector/neuvector-operator/blob/master/README.md)\n\n\n",

Please skip these versions.\n\n## Overview\nOpenshift Operator to deploy JFrog Artifactory Enterprise into your Openshift cluster.\n## Security Context Constraints\nTo deploy this helm chart you will need to be a cluster admin w/ access to the anyuid scc and add the operator service account to the anyuid scc.\n```\noc adm policy add-scc-to-user anyuid -z artifactory-ha-operator -n openshift-operators\n```\nAdd the service account for the Artifactory chart to deploy successfully:\n``` oc adm policy add-scc-to-user anyuid -z openshiftartifactoryha-artifactory-ha -n artifactory ```\n### Usage\n\nAn external DB is required. The operator will not deploy a DB but will require you to specify the configuration values to connect to it.\n\nSearch for JFrog and click JFrog Artifactory Enterprise Operator to install.\n\nGo to the Installed Operators.\n\nWait for the JFrog Artifactory Enterprise Operator to complete the installation.\n\nOpen the Operator and click on the provided API: Artifactory HA.\n\nClick Create New Instance and provide the following parameters for your DB configuration:\n\n```\nDATABASE_TYPE\nDATABASE_DRIVER\nDATABASE_URL\nDATABASE_USER\nDATABASE_PASSWORD\n```\nMaster key and Join key must be supplied. To generate a new key for each run the command below:\n\n```\n# Create a key\nexport JOIN_KEY=$(openssl rand -hex 32)\necho ${JOIN_KEY}\n```\n\nTo use TLS you will need to first create a k8s tls secret to store your .crt and .key file into.\nThen supply the value of this k8s secret into the TLS_SECRET field.\n``` oc create secret tls my_tls_secret --cert=tls.crt --key=tls.key --namespace=my_namespace ```\nClick Create for Artifactory Enterprise to deploy into OpenShift and connect to it on the external IP exposed by the load balancer.\n### Create a route\nTo expose Artifactory from Openshift we recommend you create a new route in Openshift.\nYou can either use the oc command line tool or the Openshift web console to generate a new route.\nDepending upon where you terminate TLS you will need to either specify pass through or edge.\nCommand Line (Edge):\n``` oc create route edge --service=openshiftartifactory-ha --cert=tls.crt --key=tls.key --ca-cert=ca.crt --hostname=www.example.com ```\nOr for more information visit the official Openshift documentation on routes here:\nhttps://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.6/networking/routes/route-configuration.html\n\n",

      "csv_description": "# Instana\n\nInstana is an [APM solution](https://www.instana.com/product-overview/) built for microservices that enables IT Ops to build applications faster and deliver higher quality services by automating monitoring, tracing and root cause analysis. The solution is optimized for [Kubernetes](https://www.instana.com/automatic-kubernetes-monitoring/) and [OpenShift](https://www.instana.com/blog/automatic-root-cause-analysis-for-openshift-applications/).\n\n## Instana Agent Operator\n\nThis is the Kubernetes Operator for installing the Instana Agent on Kubernetes or OpenShift.\n\n## Prerequisites for OpenShift\n\nBefore the agent will be able to run in OpenShift, you need to perform a couple of extra configuration steps.\n\nYou need to set up a project for the Instana Agent and configure it's permissions.\n\nThe project you create here needs to be the namespace where you create the Instana Agent custom resource that the operator will use to deploy the agent.\n\nFor example, create the `instana-agent` project:\n\n    oc new-project instana-agent\n\nThen, ensure the `instana-agent` service account is in the privileged security context:\n\n    oc adm policy add-scc-to-user privileged -z instana-agent\n\nThis service account will be created by the operator.\n\nNow you can proceed with installing the operator for the Instana agent.\n\n## Installation and Configuration\n\nFirst, install this operator from [OperatorHub.io](https://operatorhub.io/), [OpenShift Container Platform](https://www.openshift.com/), or [OKD](https://www.okd.io/).\n\nSecond, create a custom resource with the agent configuration in the target namespace (for now, this MUST always be the `instana-agent` namespace). The operator will pick up the custom resource and install the Instana agent accordingly.\n\nThe following is a minimal template of the custom resource:\n\n```yaml\napiVersion: instana.io/v1\nkind: InstanaAgent\nmetadata:\n  name: instana-agent\n  namespace: instana-agent\nspec:\n  zone:\n    name: my-zone # (optional) name of the zone of the host\n  cluster:\n    name: replace-me # replace with the name of your Kubernetes cluster\n  agent:\n    key: replace-me # replace with your Instana agent key\n    endpointHost: ingress-red-saas.instana.io # the monitoring ingress endpoint\n    endpointPort: \"443\" # the monitoring ingress endpoint port, wrapped in quotes\n    env:\n      INSTANA_AGENT_TAGS: example\n    configuration_yaml: |\n      # You can leave this empty, or use this to configure your instana agent.\n      # See https://docs.instana.io/setup_and_manage/host_agent/on/kubernetes/\n```\n\nSave the template in a file `instana-agent.yaml` and edit the following values:\n\n* If your target namespace is not `instana-agent`, replace the `namespace:` accordingly.\n* `agent.key` must be set with your Instana agent key.\n* `agent.endpointHost` must be set with the monitoring ingress endpoint, generally either `saas-us-west-2.instana.io` or `saas-eu-west-1.instana.io`.\n* `agent.endpointPort` must be set with the monitoring ingress port, generally \"443\" (wrapped in quotes).\n* `zone.name` should be set with the name of the Kubernetes cluster that is be displayed in Instana.\n\nFor advanced configuration, you can edit the contents of the `configuration.yaml` file. View documentation [here](https://docs.instana.io/setup_and_manage/host_agent/on/kubernetes/).\n\nApply the custom resource with `kubectl apply -f instana-agent.yaml`. After some time, you should see `instana-agent` Pods being created on each node of your cluster, and your cluster should show on the infrastructure map on your Instana Web interface.\n\n## Uninstalling\n\nIn order to uninstall the Instana agent, simply remove the custom resource with `kubectl delete -f instana-agent.yaml`.\n\n## Source Code\n\nThe Instana agent operator is an open source project hosted on [https://github.com/instana/instana-agent-operator](https://github.com/instana/instana-agent-operator/).\n",

productVersion: REPLACE_VERSION\n  scc:\n    create: true\n  sysdig:\n    accessKey: XXX\n```\nPlease, notice that `sysdig.accessKey` is **mandatory**. Once you have provided\nthe accessKey, you can apply this file with `kubectl apply -f`\n## Getting your Access Key\nTo retrieve the key and use it in the agent:\n1. Log in to Sysdig Monitor or Sysdig Secure (maybe as administrator) and\n   select **Settings**.\n2. Choose Agent Installation.\n3. Use the Copy button to copy the access key at the top of the page.\nIf you need more help, you can read more about this process in the [Agent Installation: Overview and Key](\nhttps://sysdigdocs.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/Platform/pages/213352719/Agent+Installation+Overview+and+Key)\ndocumentation page.\n## Verify Metrics in Sysdig Monitor UI\nOnce you have deployed the Sysdig Agent, it's time to verify that everything is\nworking as expected. So, we are going to log in Sysdig Monitor to do the check.\n1. Access Sysdig Monitor:\n   **SaaS**: https://app.sysdigcloud.com\n   Log in with your Sysdig user name and password.\n2. Select the **Explore** tab to see if metrics are displayed.\n3. To verify that kube state metrics and cluster name are working correctly:\n   Select the **Explore tab** and create a grouping by `kubernetes.cluster.name` and `kubernetes.pod.name`.\n4. Select an individual container or pod to see details.\nDon't rush about getting Kubernetes metadata. Pods, deployments ... appear a\nminute or two later than the nodes/containers themselves; if pod names do not\nappear immediately, wait and retry the Explore view.\nYou can read more about verification in the [Verify Metrics in Sysdig Monitor UI section](https://sysdigdocs.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/Platform/pages/256475257/GKE+Installation+Steps#GKEInstallationSteps-VerifyMetricsinSysdigMonitorUI)\nin the documentation pages.",

productVersion: REPLACE_VERSION\n  scc:\n    create: true\n  sysdig:\n    accessKey: XXX\n```\nPlease, notice that `sysdig.accessKey` is **mandatory**. Once you have provided\nthe accessKey, you can apply this file with `kubectl apply -f`\n## Getting your Access Key\nTo retrieve the key and use it in the agent:\n1. Log in to Sysdig Monitor or Sysdig Secure (maybe as administrator) and\n   select **Settings**.\n2. Choose Agent Installation.\n3. Use the Copy button to copy the access key at the top of the page.\nIf you need more help, you can read more about this process in the [Agent Installation: Overview and Key](\nhttps://sysdigdocs.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/Platform/pages/213352719/Agent+Installation+Overview+and+Key)\ndocumentation page.\n## Verify Metrics in Sysdig Monitor UI\nOnce you have deployed the Sysdig Agent, it's time to verify that everything is\nworking as expected. So, we are going to log in Sysdig Monitor to do the check.\n1. Access Sysdig Monitor:\n   **SaaS**: https://app.sysdigcloud.com\n   Log in with your Sysdig user name and password.\n2. Select the **Explore** tab to see if metrics are displayed.\n3. To verify that kube state metrics and cluster name are working correctly:\n   Select the **Explore tab** and create a grouping by `kubernetes.cluster.name` and `kubernetes.pod.name`.\n4. Select an individual container or pod to see details.\nDon't rush about getting Kubernetes metadata. Pods, deployments ... appear a\nminute or two later than the nodes/containers themselves; if pod names do not\nappear immediately, wait and retry the Explore view.\nYou can read more about verification in the [Verify Metrics in Sysdig Monitor UI section](https://sysdigdocs.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/Platform/pages/256475257/GKE+Installation+Steps#GKEInstallationSteps-VerifyMetricsinSysdigMonitorUI)\nin the documentation pages.",

Software-Defined Persistent Storage Volumes:** Enables customers to support multiple container application requirements leveraging existing SAN or DAS storage\n\n**2. CSI API Driver:** Facilitates static and dynamic provisioning for applications with RWX, RWO and ROX access modes\n\n**3. Life Cycle Management:** Enables automated deployment, configuration and upgrades of InfoScale Software-defined container images. Certified and Integrated with Red Hat OpenShift for a single-click deployment\n\n**4. Availability:** Provides scaling, mounting and/or movement of InfoScale persistent storage volumes on cluster nodes with minimal disruption\n\n**5. Data Integrity:** Prevents data corruption by allowing only the active cluster nodes to write to the volume. The I/O fencing feature recovers from cluster disruptions quickly by ensuring that application pods are moved to another node to continue normal operations\n\n**6. Point-in-Time Data Copies:** Create snapshots of Persistent Volumes for backup products, data analytics or forensic discovery and analysis\n\n**7. Disaster Recovery (DR) Tech Preview:** This DR feature provides the ability to test and validate disaster recovery capabilities by migrating Kubernetes cluster metadata and application components to peer cluster in case of a local or remote disaster\n\n---\n\n## Pre-requisites\n\n- [Please refer to pre-requisite section from official documentation](https://www.veritas.com/support/en_US/doc/151215298-151215302-0)\n\n## InfoScale Cluster custom resource\n\n```\nkind: InfoScaleCluster\nmetadata:\n  name:  < Infoscale Cluster Name >\n\nspec:\n  version: \"8.0.0.0000\"\n\n  clusterInfo:\n  - nodeName: <Name of the first node>\n  ip:\n  - <Optional - First IP address of the first node >\n  - <Optional - Second IP address of the first node>\n  excludeDevice:\n  - <Optional - Device path of the disk on the node that you want to exclude from Infoscale disk group.>\n\n  - nodeName: <Name of the second node>\n  ip:\n  - <Optional - First IP address of the second node >\n  - <Optional - Second IP address of the second node>\n  excludeDevice:\n  - <Optional - Device path of the disk on the node that you want to exclude from Infoscale disk group.>\n\n  # You can add up to 16 nodes.\n\n  licenseServer: < Optional - License server name/IP address >\n  licensePort: < Optional - License port number >\n\n  customImageRegistry: < Optional \u2013 Registry for Infoscale Container images>\n\n```\n\n#### Note\n\nYou can specify up to 16 worker nodes in CR. Although cluster configuration is allowed even with one Network Interface Card,\nVeritas recommends a minimum of two physical links for performance and High Availability (HA). Number of links for each network link must be same on all\nnodes. Optionally, you can enter node level IP addresses.

Linear scalability and\nproven fault-tolerance on commodity hardware or cloud infrastructure make it the\nperfect platform for mission-critical data. Cassandra's support for replicating\nacross multiple datacenters is best-in-class, providing lower latency for your\nusers and the peace of mind of knowing that you can survive regional outages.\n\n## DataStax Enterprise\n\nThe most advanced distribution of Apache Cassandra\u2122 on the market, with the\nenterprise functionality needed for serious production systems and backed up and\nsupported by the best distributed-experts in the world. It's one platform for\nall types of applications anywhere, any cloud, any model: key-value, graph,\ntabular, JSON.\n\nDataStax Enterprise is a fully integrated and optimized database, with graph,\nanalytics, and search included, all with a unified security model. Simply put,\nit's the only database capable of meeting today's demanding requirements\n\n## Operator Details\n\n`cass-operator` is designed as a modular operator for Apache Cassandra and\nderived  distributions. Apache Cassandra is a distributed database consisting of\nmultiple nodes working in concert to store data and process queries along a\nnumber of fault domains. `cass-operator` has the deployment of a Cassandra\ncluster around the logical domain of a datacenter with the `CassandraDatacenter`\ncustom resource.\n    \nUpon submission of one of these resources it handles provisioning the underlying\nstateful sets (analogous to C\\* logical racks), services, and configuration.\nAdditionally through monitoring pod state via Kubernetes callbacks it handles day to day\noperations such as restarting failed processes, scaling clusters up, and deploying\nconfiguration changes in a rolling, non-disruptive, fashion.\n    \nThis operator is designed to be `Namespace` scoped. A single Kubernetes cluster may\nbe running multiple instances of this operator, in separate namespaces, to support\na number of C\\* clusters and environments. Configuration is simple with the usage of\nYAML based overrides in the Custom Resource paired with an `init` container.\n    \nIn C\\* clusters ordering and timing of certain operations are important to keep the system\nevenly distributed. `cass-operator` takes advantage of a sidecar process within the\nmain container to handle the orchestration of starting our main C* process.",

IBM Security Verify SaaS provides single sign-on (SSO), multi-factor authentication (MFA), AI-powered context for risk-based authentication for adaptive access decisions, user management, access recertification campaigns and identity analytics.\n\nAs part of using Red Hat OpenShift, you are entitled to Verify SaaS SSO for unlimited apps and users.  If you do not already have a Verify SaaS SSO tenant a new one can be [created](https://www.ibm.com/account/reg/us-en/signup?formid=urx-51255).\n\nFor a detailed description of IBM Security Verify refer to the [Official documentation](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/security-verify).\n\nThe IBM Security Verify operator can consistently enforce policy-driven security by using the Ingress networking capability of OpenShift in conjunction with the [Nginx Ingress operator](https://www.nginx.com/blog/getting-started-nginx-ingress-operator-red-hat-openshift/). With this approach, you can enforce authentication and authorization policies for all of the applications in your cluster at the same time, without ever changing your application code. You can also dynamically register your application to start protecting them centrally from the cloud via Verify SaaS. \n\nSee the project [Readme](https://github.com/IBM-Security/verify-operator/blob/master/README.md) for further information and details.\n\n",

      "csv_description": "This advanced Operator is capable of deploying any runtime component image with consistent, production-grade QoS. It enables enterprise architects to govern the way their applications get deployed & managed in the cluster, while dramatically reducing the learning curve for developers to deploy into Kubernetes - allowing them to focus on writing the code!\nHere are some key features:\n\n#### Application Lifecyle\nYou can deploy your runtime component container by either pointing to a container image, or an OpenShift ImageStream. When using an ImageStream the Operator will watch for any updates and will re-deploy the modified image.\n\n#### Custom RBAC\nThis Operator is capable of using a custom ServiceAccount from the caller, allowing it to follow RBAC restrictions. By default it creates a ServiceAccount if one is not specified, which can also be bound with specific roles.\n\n#### Environment Configuration\nYou can configure a variety of artifacts with your deployment, such as: labels, annotations, and environment variables from a ConfigMap, a Secret or a value.\n\n#### Routing\nExpose your application to external users via a single toggle to create a Route on OpenShift or an Ingress on other Kubernetes environments. Advanced configuration, such as TLS settings, are also easily enabled.  Expiring Route certificates are re-issued.\n\n#### High Availability via Horizontal Pod Autoscaling\nRun multiple instances of your application for high availability. Either specify a static number of replicas or easily configure horizontal auto scaling to create (and delete) instances based on resource consumption.\n\n#### Persistence and advanced storage\nEnable persistence for your application by specifying simple requirements: just tell us the size of the storage and where you would like it to be mounted and We will create and manage that storage for you.\nThis toggles a StatefulSet resource instead of a Deployment resource, so your container can recover transactions and state upon a pod restart.\nWe offer an advanced mode where the user specifies a built-in PersistentVolumeClaim, allowing them to configure many details of the persistent volume, such as its storage class and access mode.\n\n#### Service Binding\nEasily bind to available services in your cluster.  Your runtime components can expose and consume other services by simply specifying the target endpoinds: we take care of the heavy lifting such as creating k8s Secrets, injecting them into your container and watching for any changes in configuration!  This way your applications can dynamically reconnect to its required services without any intervention or interruption.\n\n#### Exposing metrics to Prometheus\nThe Runtime Component Operator exposes the runtime container's metrics via the [Prometheus Operator](https://operatorhub.io/operator/prometheus).\nUsers can pick between a basic mode, where they simply specify the label that Prometheus is watching to scrape the metrics from the container, or they can specify the full `ServiceMonitor` spec embedded into the RuntimeComponent's `spec.monitoring` key controlling things like the poll internal and security credentials.\n\n#### Easily mount logs and transaction directories\nIf you need to mount the logs and transaction data from your runtime component to an external volume such as NFS (or any storage supported in your cluster), simply add the following (customizing the folder location and size) to your RuntimeComponent CR:\n``` storage: size: 2Gi mountPath: \"/logs\" ```\n\n#### Integration with OpenShift Serverless\nDeploy your serverless runtime component using a single toggle.  The Operator will convert all of its generated resources into [Knative](https://knative.dev) resources, allowing your pod to automatically scale to 0 when it is idle.\n\n#### Integration with OpenShift's Topology UI\nWe set the corresponding labels to support OpenShift's Developer Topology UI, which allows you to visualize your entire set of deployments and how they are connected.\n\nSee our [**documentation**](https://github.com/application-stacks/runtime-component-operator/tree/main/doc/) for more information.\n",

      "csv_description": "## Entando\n\nThe Entando platform accelerates the development and lifecycle  management of fully modularized applications on Kubernetes. It  provides tools to help developers create and manage applications  using modular frontend and backend components.\nThe Entando Operator automates the installation, provisioning, and  configuration management of the components that make up an Entando  application. Specifically, the operator manages the following custom  resources:\n**EntandoKeycloakServers** for centralized authentication of frontend  and backend components. The operator can deploy Keycloak, or in certified  environments, Red Hat SSO servers that can then be used by subsequent  deployments as an OpenID Connect provider.\n**EntandoApps** for hosting an Entando application. EntandoApps are hosted on Wildfly or JBoss EAP containers, and can also be used to deploy custom  EntandoApp containers.\n**EntandoPlugins** for deploying microservices to customize or enhance your EntandoApp. Entando microservice plugins are deployed to your cluster, and  then linked to one or more EntandoApps.\n## Using the Operator\nThe Entando Operator can be deployed using the default settings without any  configuration. Once deployed, the operator can be customized by editing  the *configmap* and secrets.\n### ConfigMap: entando-operator-config\nThe 'entando-operator-config' ConfigMap can be added after deployment and any changes to it will be picked up by the operator on subsequent event processing. It supports the following keys:\n\n    entando.k8s.operator.gc.controller.pods: set this to \"false\" to keep controller pods after completion.\n    entando.k8s.operator.compliance.mode: set this to \"community\" if there is no requirement for Red Hat compliance.\n    entando.k8s.operator.image.pull.secrets: a comma separated list containing the names of pull secrets that will be linked to all service accounts.\n    entando.k8s.operator.disable.pvc.garbage.collection: set this to \"false\" if you want Persistent Volume Claims to be deleted with the custom resources they are associated with.\n    entando.k8s.operator.impose.default.limits: set this to \"false\" if there is no need to limit the resource consumption of pods on your cluster.\n    entando.k8s.operator.request.to.limit.ratio: a decimal number that default limits will be multiplied by to calculate default requests for resources.\n    entando.k8s.operator.force.db.password.reset: set this to \"true\" if you plan to delete Secrets from your namespace but you want to retain the Database they point to.\n    entando.k8s.operator.pull.policy.override: specify your preferred pullPolicy for images. The default is Always.\n    entando.tls.secret.name: The name of a standard TLS secret to use for HTTPS Ingresses. See the section entando-tls-secret.\n    entando.ca.secret.name: The name of a secret containing CA certificates. See the section entando-ca-cert-secret.\n    entando.assume.external.https.provider: Set this to \"true\" if your cloud provider handles HTTPS for you.\n    entando.use.auto.cert.generation: Set this to \"true\" to have Openshift use its internal CA to generate certificates for your Routes.\n    entando.default.routing.suffix: The domain name that can be suffixed to deployment names when the ingressHostName is omitted. Needs to be preconfigured on your DNS provider.\n    entando.pod.completion.timeout.seconds: The time it will take before Entando fails a run-to-completion Pod.\n    entando.pod.readiness.timeout.seconds: The time it will take before Entando fails a Service Pod.\n    entando.pod.shutdown.timeout.seconds: The time Entando will give a Pod to shutdown gracefully.\n\n\n### entando-pull-secret\nThe secret to be used to pull Entando images from the Red Hat container registry. The name of this secret is hard coded as it is required for the ClusterServiceVersion of this Operator\n### entando-tls-secret\nA standard Kubernetes TLS secret that will be used on all deployments where no custom TLS secret name is specified.\n### entando-ca-cert-secret\nThis is an opaque secret in the Entando Operator's namespace that contains the certificates of all trusted certificate authorities in your environment. This is generally used mainly for self signed certificates. As is generally the case for opaque secrets, there are no constraints on the keys in this secret. However, limit the files inside the secret to X509 certificates or certificate chains. The Entando Operator will load all of these files into a Java keystore that it then configures as the trust store for each container that uses Java.\n",

It  provides tools to help developers create and manage applications  using modular frontend and backend components.\nThe Entando Operator automates the installation, provisioning, and  configuration management of the components that make up an Entando  application. Specifically, the operator manages the following custom  resources:\n**EntandoKeycloakServers** for centralized authentication of frontend  and backend components. The operator can deploy Keycloak, or in certified  environments, Red Hat SSO servers that can then be used by subsequent  deployments as an OpenID Connect provider.\n**EntandoApps** for hosting an Entando application. EntandoApps are hosted on Wildfly or JBoss EAP containers, and can also be used to deploy custom  EntandoApp containers.\n**EntandoPlugins** for deploying microservices to customize or enhance your EntandoApp. Entando microservice plugins are deployed to your cluster, and  then linked to one or more EntandoApps.\n## Using the Operator\nThe Entando Operator can be deployed using the default settings without any  configuration. Once deployed, the operator can be customized by editing  the *configmap* and secrets.\n### ConfigMap: entando-operator-config\nThe 'entando-operator-config' ConfigMap can be added after deployment and any changes to it will be picked up by the operator on subsequent event processing. It supports the following keys:\n\n    entando.k8s.operator.gc.controller.pods: set this to \"false\" to keep controller pods after completion.\n    entando.k8s.operator.compliance.mode: set this to \"community\" if there is no requirement for Red Hat compliance.\n    entando.k8s.operator.image.pull.secrets: a comma separated list containing the names of pull secrets that will be linked to all service accounts.\n    entando.k8s.operator.disable.pvc.garbage.collection: set this to \"false\" if you want Persistent Volume Claims to be deleted with the custom resources they are associated with.\n    entando.k8s.operator.impose.default.limits: set this to \"false\" if there is no need to limit the resource consumption of pods on your cluster.\n    entando.k8s.operator.request.to.limit.ratio: a decimal number that default limits will be multiplied by to calculate default requests for resources.\n    entando.k8s.operator.force.db.password.reset: set this to \"true\" if you plan to delete Secrets from your namespace but you want to retain the Database they point to.\n    entando.k8s.operator.pull.policy.override: specify your preferred pullPolicy for images. The default is Always.\n    entando.tls.secret.name: The name of a standard TLS secret to use for HTTPS Ingresses. See the section entando-tls-secret.\n    entando.ca.secret.name: The name of a secret containing CA certificates. See the section entando-ca-cert-secret.\n    entando.assume.external.https.provider: Set this to \"true\" if your cloud provider handles HTTPS for you.\n    entando.use.auto.cert.generation: Set this to \"true\" to have Openshift use its internal CA to generate certificates for your Routes.\n    entando.default.routing.suffix: The domain name that can be suffixed to deployment names when the ingressHostName is omitted. Needs to be preconfigured on your DNS provider.\n    entando.pod.completion.timeout.seconds: The time it will take before Entando fails a run-to-completion Pod.\n    entando.pod.readiness.timeout.seconds: The time it will take before Entando fails a Service Pod.\n    entando.pod.shutdown.timeout.seconds: The time Entando will give a Pod to shutdown gracefully.\n\n\n### entando-pull-secret\nThe secret to be used to pull Entando images from the Red Hat container registry. The name of this secret is hard coded as it is required for the ClusterServiceVersion of this Operator\n### entando-tls-secret\nA standard Kubernetes TLS secret that will be used on all deployments where no custom TLS secret name is specified.\n### entando-ca-cert-secret\nThis is an opaque secret in the Entando Operator's namespace that contains the certificates of all trusted certificate authorities in your environment. This is generally used mainly for self signed certificates. As is generally the case for opaque secrets, there are no constraints on the keys in this secret. However, limit the files inside the secret to X509 certificates or certificate chains. The Entando Operator will load all of these files into a Java keystore that it then configures as the trust store for each container that uses Java.\n",

It  provides tools to help developers create and manage applications  using modular frontend and backend components.\nThe Entando Operator automates the installation, provisioning, and  configuration management of the components that make up an Entando  application. Specifically, the operator manages the following custom  resources:\n**EntandoKeycloakServers** for centralized authentication of frontend  and backend components. The operator can deploy Keycloak, or in certified  environments, Red Hat SSO servers that can then be used by subsequent  deployments as an OpenID Connect provider.\n**EntandoApps** for hosting an Entando application. EntandoApps are hosted on Wildfly or JBoss EAP containers, and can also be used to deploy custom  EntandoApp containers.\n**EntandoPlugins** for deploying microservices to customize or enhance your EntandoApp. Entando microservice plugins are deployed to your cluster, and  then linked to one or more EntandoApps.\n## Using the Operator\nThe Entando Operator can be deployed using the default settings without any  configuration. Once deployed, the operator can be customized by editing  the *configmap* and secrets.\n### ConfigMap: entando-operator-config\nThe 'entando-operator-config' ConfigMap can be added after deployment and any changes to it will be picked up by the operator on subsequent event processing. It supports the following keys:\n\n    entando.k8s.operator.gc.controller.pods: set this to \"false\" to keep controller pods after completion.\n    entando.k8s.operator.compliance.mode: set this to \"community\" if there is no requirement for Red Hat compliance.\n    entando.k8s.operator.image.pull.secrets: a comma separated list containing the names of pull secrets that will be linked to all service accounts.\n    entando.k8s.operator.disable.pvc.garbage.collection: set this to \"false\" if you want Persistent Volume Claims to be deleted with the custom resources they are associated with.\n    entando.k8s.operator.impose.default.limits: set this to \"false\" if there is no need to limit the resource consumption of pods on your cluster.\n    entando.k8s.operator.request.to.limit.ratio: a decimal number that default limits will be multiplied by to calculate default requests for resources.\n    entando.k8s.operator.force.db.password.reset: set this to \"true\" if you plan to delete Secrets from your namespace but you want to retain the Database they point to.\n    entando.k8s.operator.pull.policy.override: specify your preferred pullPolicy for images. The default is Always.\n    entando.tls.secret.name: The name of a standard TLS secret to use for HTTPS Ingresses. See the section entando-tls-secret.\n    entando.ca.secret.name: The name of a secret containing CA certificates. See the section entando-ca-cert-secret.\n    entando.assume.external.https.provider: Set this to \"true\" if your cloud provider handles HTTPS for you.\n    entando.use.auto.cert.generation: Set this to \"true\" to have Openshift use its internal CA to generate certificates for your Routes.\n    entando.default.routing.suffix: The domain name that can be suffixed to deployment names when the ingressHostName is omitted. Needs to be preconfigured on your DNS provider.\n    entando.pod.completion.timeout.seconds: The time it will take before Entando fails a run-to-completion Pod.\n    entando.pod.readiness.timeout.seconds: The time it will take before Entando fails a Service Pod.\n    entando.pod.shutdown.timeout.seconds: The time Entando will give a Pod to shutdown gracefully.\n\n\n### entando-pull-secret\nThe secret to be used to pull Entando images from the Red Hat container registry. The name of this secret is hard coded as it is required for the ClusterServiceVersion of this Operator\n### entando-tls-secret\nA standard Kubernetes TLS secret that will be used on all deployments where no custom TLS secret name is specified.\n### entando-ca-cert-secret\nThis is an opaque secret in the Entando Operator's namespace that contains the certificates of all trusted certificate authorities in your environment. This is generally used mainly for self signed certificates. As is generally the case for opaque secrets, there are no constraints on the keys in this secret. However, limit the files inside the secret to X509 certificates or certificate chains. The Entando Operator will load all of these files into a Java keystore that it then configures as the trust store for each container that uses Java.\n",

      "csv_description": "LINSTOR is a configuration management system for storage on Linux systems.\nIt manages LVM logical volumes and/or ZFS ZVOLs on a cluster of nodes.\nIt leverages DRBD for replication between different nodes and to provide block\nstorage devices to users and applications. It manages snapshots, encryption and\ncaching of HDD backed data in SSDs via bcache.\n\nLINBIT provides a certified LINSTOR operator to ease deployment of LINSTOR\non Openshift by installing DRBD, managing Satellite and Controller pods,\nand integrating with Openshift to provision persistent storage for your workloads.\n\nFor detailed instructions and more configuration options, see our [user guide].\n\n[user guide]: https://www.linbit.com/drbd-user-guide/linstor-guide-1_0-en/#ch-openshift\n\n## Install\n\nUnlike deployment via the helm chart, the certified Openshift\noperator does not deploy the needed etcd cluster. You must deploy this\nyourself ahead of time. We do this via the etcd operator available in the\nOperatorHub.\n\nIMPORTANT: It is advised that the etcd deployment uses persistent\nstorage of some type. Either use an existing storage provisioner with\na default `StorageClass` or simply use `hostPath` volumes.\n\n### Installing the operator\n\nHit \"Install\", select the stable update channel and a namespace for the\noperator. Use of a new namespace is recommended.\n\nHit \"Install\" again. At this point you should have just one pod, the\noperator pod, running. Next we needs to configure the remaining provided APIs.\n\n#### A note on operator namespaces\nThe LINSTOR operator can only watch for events and manage\ncustom resources that are within the same namespace it is deployed\nwithin (OwnNamsespace). This means the LINSTOR Controller, LINSTOR\nSatellites, and LINSTOR CSI Driver pods all need to be deployed in the\nsame namsepace as the LINSTOR Operator pod.\n\n### Deploying the LINSTOR Controller\n\nNavigate to the left-hand control pane of the Openshift Web\nConsole. Expand the \"Operators\" section, selecting \"Installed Operators\".\nFind the entry for the \"Linstor Operator\", then select the \"LinstorController\"\nfrom the \"Provided APIs\" column on the right.\n\nFrom here you should see a page that says \"No Operands Found\" and will\nfeature a large button on the right which says \"Create\nLinstorController\". Click the \"Create LinstorController\" button.\n\nHere you will be presented with options to configure the LINSTOR\nController. Either via the web-form view or the YAML View. Regardless\nof which view you select, make sure that the `dbConnectionURL` matches\nthe endpoint provided from your etcd deployment. Otherwise, the\ndefaults are usually fine for most purposes.\n\nLastly hit \"Create\", you should now see a linstor-controller pod\nrunning.\n\n### Deploying the LINSTOR Satellites\n\nNext we need to deploy the Satellites Set. Just as before navigate\nto the left-hand control pane of the Openshift Web Console. Expand the\n\"Operators\" section, but this time select \"Installed Operators\". Find\nthe entry for the \"Linstor Operator\", then select the\n\"LinstorSatelliteSet\" from the \"Provided APIs\" column on the right.\n\nFrom here you should see a page that says \"No Operands Found\" and will\nfeature a large button on the right which says \"Create\nLinstorSatelliteSet\". Click the \"Create LinstorSatelliteSet\" button.\n\nHere you will be presented with the options to configure the LINSTOR\nSatellites. The defaults should be enough to get you started.\nMake sure the `controllerEndpoint` matches what is available in the\nopenshift endpoints. The default is usually correct here.\n\nYou can edit the `storagePools` section to configure LINSTOR storage pools,\nincluding preparing the backing devices. See our [storage guide].\n\n[storage guide]: https://www.linbit.com/drbd-user-guide/linstor-guide-1_0-en/#s-kubernetes-storage\n\nBelow is an example manifest:\n\n```yaml\napiVersion: linstor.linbit.com/v1\nkind: LinstorSatelliteSet\nmetadata:\n  name: linstor-satellites\nspec:\n  satelliteImage: ''\n  automaticStorageType: None\n  storagePools:\n    lvmThinPools:\n    - name: openshift-pool\n      volumeGroup: \"\"\n      thinVolume: openshift\n      devicePaths:\n      - /dev/vdb\n  drbdRepoCred: ''\n  kernelModuleInjectionMode: ShippedModules\n  controllerEndpoint: 'http://linstor:3370'\n  priorityClassName: ''\n```\n\nLastly hit \"Create\", you should now see a linstor-node pod\nrunning on every worker node.\n\n### Deploying the LINSTOR CSI driver\n\nLast bit left is the CSI pods to bridge the layer between the CSI and\nLINSTOR. Just as before navigate to the left-hand control pane of the\nOpenshift Web Console. Expand the \"Operators\" section, but this time\nselect \"Installed Operators\". Find the entry for the \"Linstor Operator\",\nthen select the \"LinstorCSIDriver\" from the \"Provided APIs\" column on the\nright.\n\nFrom here you should see a page that says \"No Operands Found\" and will\nfeature a large button on the right which says \"Create\nLinstorCSIDriver\". Click the \"Create LinstorCSIDriver\" button.\n\nAgain, you will be presented with the options. Make sure that the\n`controllerEndpoint` is correct. Otherwise the defaults are fine for\nmost use cases.\n\nLastly hit \"Create\". You will now see a single \"linstor-csi-controller\" pod,\nas well as a \"linstor-csi-node\" pod on all worker nodes.\n\n## Interacting with LINSTOR in Openshift.\n\nThe Controller pod includes a LINSTOR Client, making it easy to interact directly with LINSTOR.\nFor instance:\n\n```\noc exec deployment/linstor-cs-controller -- linstor storage-pool list\n```\n\nThis should only be necessary for investigating problems and accessing advanced functionality.\nRegular operation such as creating volumes should be achieved via the [Openshift/Kubernetes integration].\n\n[Openshift/Kubernetes integration]: https://www.linbit.com/drbd-user-guide/linstor-guide-1_0-en/#s-kubernetes-basic-configuration-and-deployment",

      "csv_description": "Federator.ai helps enterprises optimize cloud resources, maximize application performance, and save significant cost without excessive over-provisioning or under-provisioning of resources, meeting the service-level requirements of their applications.\n\nEnterprises often lack understanding of the resources needed to support their applications. This leads to either excessive over-provisioning or under-provisioning of resources (CPU, memory, storage). Using machine learning, Federator.ai determines the optimal cloud resources needed to support any workload on OpenShift and helps users find the best-cost instances from cloud providers for their applications.\n\n\n**Multi-layer workload prediction**\n\nUsing machine learning and math-based algorithms, Federator.ai predicts containerized application and cluster node resource usage as the basis for resource recommendations at application level as well as at cluster node level. Federator.ai supports prediction for both physical/virtual CPUs and memories.\n\n\n**Auto-scaling via resource recommendation**\n\nFederator.ai utilizes the predicted resource usage to recommend the right number and size of pods for applications. Integrated with Datadog's WPA, applications are automatically scaled to meet the predicted resource usage.\n\n\n**Application-aware recommendation execution**\n\nOptimizing the resource usage and performance goals, Federator.ai uses application specific metrics for workload prediction and pod capacity estimation to auto-scale the right number of pods for best performance without overprovisioning.\n\n\n**Multi-cloud Cost Analysis**\n\nWith resource usage prediction, Federator.ai analyzes potential cost of a cluster on different public cloud providers. It also recommend appropriate cluster nodes and instance types based on resource usage.\n\n\n**Custom Datadog/Sysdig Dashboards**\n\nPredefined custom Datadog/Sysdig Dashboards for workload prediction/recommendation visualization for cluster nodes and applications.\n\n\n**Additional resources**\n\nWant more product information?

      "csv_description": "Federator.ai helps enterprises optimize cloud resources, maximize application performance, and save significant cost without excessive over-provisioning or under-provisioning of resources, meeting the service-level requirements of their applications.\n\nEnterprises often lack understanding of the resources needed to support their applications. This leads to either excessive over-provisioning or under-provisioning of resources (CPU, memory, storage). Using machine learning, Federator.ai determines the optimal cloud resources needed to support any workload on OpenShift and helps users find the best-cost instances from cloud providers for their applications.\n\n\n**Multi-layer workload prediction**\n\nUsing machine learning and math-based algorithms, Federator.ai predicts containerized application and cluster node resource usage as the basis for resource recommendations at application level as well as at cluster node level. Federator.ai supports prediction for both physical/virtual CPUs and memories.\n\n\n**Auto-scaling via resource recommendation**\n\nFederator.ai utilizes the predicted resource usage to recommend the right number and size of pods for applications. Integrated with Datadog's WPA, applications are automatically scaled to meet the predicted resource usage.\n\n\n**Application-aware recommendation execution**\n\nOptimizing the resource usage and performance goals, Federator.ai uses application specific metrics for workload prediction and pod capacity estimation to auto-scale the right number of pods for best performance without overprovisioning.\n\n\n**Multi-cloud Cost Analysis**\n\nWith resource usage prediction, Federator.ai analyzes potential cost of a cluster on different public cloud providers. It also recommend appropriate cluster nodes and instance types based on resource usage.\n\n\n**Custom Datadog/Sysdig Dashboards**\n\nPredefined custom Datadog/Sysdig Dashboards for workload prediction/recommendation visualization for cluster nodes and applications.\n\n\n**Additional resources**\n\nWant more product information?

      "csv_description": "The Dynatrace Operator supports rollout and lifecycle of various Dynatrace components in Kubernetes and OpenShift.\n\nAs of launch, the Dynatrace Operator can be used to deploy a containerized ActiveGate for Kubernetes API monitoring. New capabilities will be added to the Dynatrace Operator over time including metric routing, and API monitoring for AWS, Azure, GCP, and vSphere.\n\nWith v0.2.0 we added the classicFullStack functionality which allows rolling out the OneAgent to your Kubernetes cluster.\nFurthermore, the Dynatrace Operator is now capable of rolling out a containerized ActiveGate for routing the OneAgent traffic.\n\n### Installation\nOnce you've installed the Dynatrace Operator, you can create a DynaKube custom resource.\n\nFirst, please add a Secret within the Project you've deployed the Dynatrace Operator to, which would contain your API and PaaS tokens. Create tokens of type *Dynatrace API* (`API_TOKEN`) and *Platform as a Service* (`PAAS_TOKEN`) and use their values in the following commands respectively.\n\nFor assistance please refer to [Create user-generated access tokens](https://www.dynatrace.com/support/help/shortlink/token#create-user-generated-access-tokens).\n\n``` $ oc -n <project> create secret generic dynakube --from-literal=\"apiToken=API_TOKEN\" --from-literal=\"paasToken=PAAS_TOKEN\" ```\n\nYou may update this Secret at any time to rotate the tokens.\n\nAfter creation of the secret add the DynaKube object in the project where the Dynatrace Operator has been deployed, configured to your needs.\n\n### Required Parameters\n* `apiUrl` - provide the URL to the API of your Dynatrace environment. In Dynatrace SaaS it will look like `https://<ENVIRONMENTID>.live.dynatrace.com/api` . In Dynatrace Managed like `https://<YourDynatraceServerURL>/e/<ENVIRONMENTID>/api` .\n\n### Advanced Options\n* **Disable Certificate Checking** - disable any certificate validation that may interact poorly with proxies with in your cluster\n* **Image Override** - use a copy of the ActiveGate container image from a registry other than Docker's or Red Hat's\n\n#### Kubernetes Monitoring\n* **Kubernetes Monitoring** - when enabled the Dynatrace Operator will create a containerized ActiveGate with the capability to monitor your OpenShift cluster\n* **Replicas** - defines how many replicas of the containerized ActiveGate should be created\n* **NodeSelectors** - select a subset of your cluster's nodes to run the Dynatrace ActiveGate on, based on labels\n* **Environment variables** - define environment variables for the ActiveGate container\n\nFor a complete list of supported parameters please consult the [Operator Deploy Guide](https://www.dynatrace.com/support/help/shortlink/openshift-deploy).\n\n### Help\nYou can find more about our instructions in our [documentation](https://www.dynatrace.com/support/help/shortlink/openshift-deploy#install-dynatrace-operator).\n",

      "csv_description": "\n## Introduction\n\n[vFunction](https://www.vfunction.com/) is a cloud-native modernization platform that combines dynamic and static code analysis, machine learning, and automation to automatically identify and extract services from existing applications. vFunction is the only platform purpose-built for modernization of Java applications.\n\nThe vFunction modernization process starts by learning the running monolithic application, and surfacing the interdependencies within it. Using AI, the platform analyzes and identifies services that can be separated from the application. This decomposition can present a range of micro, mini, or even macro services, depending on your application environment, each being an independently deployable and scalable application component.\n\nvFunction automates the extraction of these services, enabling you to modernize your monolith, quickly and easily.\n\n## The vFunction platform\n\nThe platform consists of 3 basic components; the server, the controller package, and a tools package. The server runs as an operand on an OpenShift environment. The controller package is installed on the machine that runs the monolithic application which can be either a Linux or a Windows machine, and the tools are run on a development machine, with access to the code of the monolithic application.\n\nThe controller package consists of three elements: the vFunction agent, that collects data during the dynamic analysis phase; the vFunction Viper application, that performs static analysis on the binaries of the application; and the vFunction controller that handles all the communication between the agent, Viper, and the vFunction server.\n\nThe vFunction agent is a mix of a Java and native agent, and needs to run on the JVM that is currently running your application. [Refer to the vFunction OOB Support Matrix document](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ccq8LFab1FrYAimDUxwgjiCOdk4QuVzs/view) for a list of supported application servers and JVMs.\n\nThis operator installs a vFunction server instance to be connected later with one or more vFunction controllers installed on your application machine(s).\n\n## Before You Start\n\nThe vFunction operator requires a Red Hat OpenShift Kubernetes Application Platform 4.x.\n\nThe cluster recommended configuration (which is the same as the minimal one) should consist of:\n\n- *1 master node*\n\n- *1 worker node*\n\n- *Storage capacity enough for dynamically provision 2 PVs of 50G each*\n\n- *A default StorageClass configured*\n\nvFunction doesn\u2019t provide any encryption mechanism for data stored on any attached storage. If required, encryption can be achieved by the client by using its own external means on the storage itself.\n\nvFunction supports backup of all critical data as part of the application. Nevertheless, for complete backup of entire data it is recommended that the client apply its own storage based backup mechanism.\n\n## Install Prerequisites\n\n###Cluster:\nThe operator was certified and tested on OCP 4.6 and 4.7.\nIf you encounter any issue with other OCP versions or cloud providers please contact info@vfunction.com.\n\n###Storage:\nThe operator creates two new PersistentVolumeClaims (PVCs) during installation time. For their creation, it relies on the default StorageClass to dynamically provision two PersistentVolumes (PVs). The system must have a default StorageClass in place.\n\nBoth PersistentVolumes are accessed with ReadWriteOnce mode.\n\n###Project:\nThe operator should be installed in a new and dedicated project (namespace). If you intend to install more than one vFunction operands in the same cluster, please use different projects for each one. Installation of more than one operand on the same cluster will allow scaling by load balancing multiple applications to different vFunction servers.\n\n## Installation instructions\n\n1. Prepare the YAML file to use in the installation:\n\n    a. Copy the following YAML template into a text editor:\n\n    ```yaml\n        apiVersion: vfunction.com/v1\n        kind: VfunctionServer\n        metadata:\n          name: vfunction\n          namespace: vfunction\n          labels:\n            name: vfunction\n            app.kubernetes.io/name: vfunction\n            app.kubernetes.io/instance: vfunction-server\n            app.kubernetes.io/managed-by: operator\n        spec:\n          host: \"http://my.domain.com\"\n          org_name: \"MyCompany\"\n          upgrade: \"Daily\"\n          admin:\n            email: \"admin@mycompany.com\"\n            name: \"Admin\"\n            password: \"Password1!\"\n          smtp:\n            password: \"\"\n            url: \"\"\n            identity: \"\"\n            user: \"\"\n          measurements:\n            auto_scaling: \"No\"\n            min_number_of_services: \"2\"\n            max_number_of_services: \"10\"\n          tls:\n            crt: |\n              -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----\n              ...\n              -----END CERTIFICATE-----\n            key: |\n              -----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----\n              ...\n              -----END PRIVATE KEY-----\n    ```\n    b. Customize the template fields by replacing with your information:\n\n    - **host**: Enter the FQDN for accessing the vFunction dashboard.\n                Make sure that you use a domain name and not an IP address. Writing \"https://\" will mandate TLS while writing \"http://\" will expose the server through HTTP.\n    - **org_name**: Enter your organization name.\n    - **upgrade**: Choose auto-upgrade mode\n        - **Daily**: The operator will check for a new version every day at 3 AM and will install it automatically (default).\n        - **Always**: The operator will check for a new version every 10 minutes and will install it automatically.\n        - **Never**: The automatic upgrading mechanism is off.\n        - **Maintenance**: Put the operator in a maintenance mode.\n\n    - **admin.email**: Enter the email address of your administrator.\n    - **admin.name**: Enter the name of your administrator.\n    - **admin.password**: Enter the password you want to use for the vFunction administrator.\n                          The password should be at least 8 characters long, and consist of at least one lowercase letter, at least one uppercase letter, at least one number, and at least one special character.\n    - **smtp.user**: Enter the email address for a designated user for the SMTP server (optional).\n    - **smtp.password**: Enter this user\u2019s password (optional).\n    - **smtp.identity**: Enter this user\u2019s password (optional).\n    - **smtp.url**: Enter the SMTP server URL (optional).\n    - **tls.crt**: If your host FQDN starts with \u201chttps\u201d, paste in the certifications you have for using the TLS connection.\n    - **tls.key**: If your host FQDN starts with \u201chttps\u201d, enter the key you have for using the TLS connection.\n    - **measurements.auto_scaling**: Indicates if the measurement services auto scalling is active.\n    - **measurements.min_num_of_services**: Minimum Number of measurement service pods.\n    - **measurements.max_num_of_services**: Maximum Number of measurement service pods.\n    - **measurements.S3**: Save all measurements data to S3, instead of local PV (optional).\n        - **measurements.S3.bucket**: Measurements S3 bucket name.\n        - **measurements.S3.key**: Measurements S3 key.\n        - **measurements.S3.secret**: Measurements S3 secret.\n        - **measurements.S3.region**: Measurements S3 region.\n    - **backup.mysql.S3**: Backup MySQL to S3 (optional).\n        - **backup.mysql.S3.bucket**: MySQL backup S3 bucket name.\n        - **backup.mysql.S3.key**: MySQL backup S3 key.\n        - **backup.mysql.S3.secret**: MySQL backup S3 secret.\n        - **backup.mysql.S3.region**: MySQL backup S3 region.\n\n1. In the Installed Operators window choose and click on vFunction Operator and then Create Instance.\n1. In the Create vFunctionServer window, paste the YAML file that you created in step 1.\n1. Click Create.\n1. You can now click on your new created vFunction operand in order to see its details and installation progress.\n\n## Verifying the installation\n\nCheck that the operand installed successfully:\n\n1. Check that the \"Operand State\" property shows \u201cWorking\u201d.\n1. Check that the \"Successfully Installed\" property shows \"Yes\".\n\nIf \"Operand State\" shows \"Failed\", it indicates the operand wasn\u2019t installed correctly. Check the events and logs for all pods (operator and image containers) for any issues. In the event that you cannot troubleshoot, contact vFunction support.\n\n## After installation\n\nThe vFunction site is now accessible via the newly created vFunction application custom address, for example, my.domain.com. There are two ways you can access the vFunction dashboard.\n\n### Access using the router canonical hostname\n\n1. Update your DNS provider by creating a canonical name (CNAME) record.\nThis record should point to your host address, and to the \u201dvfunction\u201d subdomain of the  OpenShift canonical router hostname as the alias.\nFor example, ***my.domain.com.   CNAME   vfunction.apps.ocp4.my-openshift.com.***\n2. Find your cluster Router Canonical Hostname address in the newly created vfunction-route-xxx under your vFunction OpenShift project -> **Networking** -> **Routes** -> **vfunction-route-xxx** route -> **Router Canonical Hostname** field.\nYou can now access the dashboard using your defined \"host\" spec property (as above).\n\n### Access using the nginx service location\n\nYou may use this access method if your OpenShift is installed on a provider that supports exposing LoadBalancer-type services.\n1. Update your DNS provider by creating a canonical name (CNAME) record.\nThis record should point to your host address and to the vfunction-nginx-xxx service location.\nFor example, ***my.domain.com.   CNAME   a05951ed7cdf-1394239323.us-east-1.elb.amazonaws.com.***\n1. Point your custom domain to the vfunction-nginx-xxx service's external IP location, which you can find in the OpenShift project > **Networking** -> **Services** -> **vfunction-nginx-xxx** service > **Service Address** > **Location** field.\n\n## Upgrade and Rollback\n\nThe vFunction operator includes a built-in auto-upgrade mechanism.\n\nYou can choose one of 4 upgrading modes:\n- **Daily**: The operator will check for a new version every day at 3 AM and will install it automatically (default).\n- **Always**: The operator will check for a new version every 10 minutes and will install it automatically.\n- **Never**: The automatic upgrading mechanism is off.\n- **Maintenance**: Put the operator in a maintenance mode.\n\nFor an on-demand upgrade,  you can change anytime the upgrading mode from \u201cNever\u201d to \u201cAlways\u201d, wait for the operand to be upgraded, and change again to \u201cNever\u201d.\n\nDuring the upgrade, the \"Operand State\" property will change to \u201cUpgrading...\u201d and back again to \u201cWorking\u201d after a successful upgrade.\n\nIn case of a failure upgrading the operand, an automatic rollback to the last working version will occur. The failed version will be marked as defective and the operator will not try to upgrade to it again.\n\nChoosing the \"Maintenance\" option will tell the operator to take down all pods, so you can safely fix storage issues, return volumes from snapshots, etc.\nAfter finishing the maintenance, return the upgrade mode to your original desired policy.",

By installing this integration you will be able to deploy Zabbix server / proxies and other components with a single command.\n## Supported Features\n* **Zabbix Server** - Simple Zabbix installation with included Zabbix server, Zabbix web-interface and Zabbix Java Gateway with MySQL database support. The feature does not provide MySQL service and requires an external MySQL database. \n* **Zabbix Server (Full)** - Zabbix installation with included Zabbix server, Zabbix web-interface, Zabbix Java Gateway and MySQL server instance.\n* **Zabbix proxy (SQLite3)** - Very simple way to gain power of Zabbix proxy. The feature has  SQLite3 support for Zabbix proxies and allow to specify amount of proxies. \n* **Zabbix proxy (MySQL)** - Another option of Zabbix proxy. The option support and deliver MySQL database.\n* **Zabbix agent** - Zabbix agent can be deployed on each available node for stability and performance monitoring on remote nodes. It allows to gather metrics with full automation!\n* **Zabbix Appliance** - Zabbix appliance very simple way to test and check Zabbix features. The option provides all core components in one solution. It includes Zabbix server, Zabbix Java Gateway, Zabbix web-interface and MySQL server in deployment. It is very useful for testing Zabbix features!\n## Prerequisites\nAll deployment options are require additional information during deployment. Please, check the following instructions and provide required configuration:\n* **Zabbix Server** - MySQL database host information and MySQL database credentials in specially formatted *Secret*. Additionally it is possible to specify SSL certificates for HTTPS support in *Secret*.\n* **Zabbix Server (Full)** - MySQL database credentials in specially formatted *Secret*. MySQL database volume name information. Additionally it is possible to specify SSL certificates for HTTPS support in *Secret*.\n* **Zabbix proxy (SQLite3)** - Zabbix server host information only.\n* **Zabbix proxy (MySQL)** - MySQL database credentials in specially formatted *Secrets* and Zabbix server host information.\n* **Zabbix agent** - Zabbix server host information only for outgoing and incoming connections. Zabbix agent uses \"privileged\" mode to monitor node resources! For example, running processes.\n* **Zabbix Appliance** - MySQL database credentials in specially formatted *Secret*. MySQL database volume name information. Additionally it is possible to specify SSL certificates for HTTPS support in *Secret*.\n### MySQL credentials\n```\nkind: Secret\napiVersion: v1\nmetadata:\n  name: zabbix-full-secrets\ndata:\n  mysql_root_password: emFiYml4X3N1cGVyX3Jvb3Q= [1]\n  mysql_zabbix_password: emFiYml4X3VzZXJfcGFzc3dvcmQ= [2]\n  mysql_zabbix_username: emFiYml4 [3]\ntype: Opaque\n```\nUsing MySQL root password (*mysqlrootpassword* [1]) Zabbix server / proxy will try to create MySQL database schema with grant permissions to *mysqlzabbixusername* [2] and *mysqlzabbixpassword* [3].\n### SSL certificates for HTTPS\n```\nkind: Secret\napiVersion: v1\nmetadata:\n  name: zabbix-web-sslsecret\ndata:\n  ssl.crt: >-\n   < ssl.crt data>\n  ssl.key: >-\n\t < ssl.key data >\n  dhparam.pem: >-\n   <  dhparam.pem data >\n```\nFiles *ssl.crt*, *ssl.key* and *dhparam.perm* are required for Zabbix web-interface for SSL support.\n",

By installing this integration you will be able to deploy Zabbix server / proxies and other components with a single command.\n## Supported Features\n* **Zabbix Server** - Simple Zabbix installation with included Zabbix server, Zabbix web-interface and Zabbix Java Gateway with MySQL database support. The feature does not provide MySQL service and requires an external MySQL database. \n* **Zabbix Server (Full)** - Zabbix installation with included Zabbix server, Zabbix web-interface, Zabbix Java Gateway and MySQL server instance.\n* **Zabbix proxy (SQLite3)** - Very simple way to gain power of Zabbix proxy. The feature has  SQLite3 support for Zabbix proxies and allow to specify amount of proxies. \n* **Zabbix proxy (MySQL)** - Another option of Zabbix proxy. The option support and deliver MySQL database.\n* **Zabbix agent** - Zabbix agent can be deployed on each available node for stability and performance monitoring on remote nodes. It allows to gather metrics with full automation!\n* **Zabbix Appliance** - Zabbix appliance very simple way to test and check Zabbix features. The option provides all core components in one solution. It includes Zabbix server, Zabbix Java Gateway, Zabbix web-interface and MySQL server in deployment. It is very useful for testing Zabbix features!\n## Prerequisites\nAll deployment options are require additional information during deployment. Please, check the following instructions and provide required configuration:\n* **Zabbix Server** - MySQL database host information and MySQL database credentials in specially formatted *Secret*. Additionally it is possible to specify SSL certificates for HTTPS support in *Secret*.\n* **Zabbix Server (Full)** - MySQL database credentials in specially formatted *Secret*. MySQL database volume name information. Additionally it is possible to specify SSL certificates for HTTPS support in *Secret*.\n* **Zabbix proxy (SQLite3)** - Zabbix server host information only.\n* **Zabbix proxy (MySQL)** - MySQL database credentials in specially formatted *Secrets* and Zabbix server host information.\n* **Zabbix agent** - Zabbix server host information only for outgoing and incoming connections. Zabbix agent uses \"privileged\" mode to monitor node resources! For example, running processes.\n* **Zabbix Appliance** - MySQL database credentials in specially formatted *Secret*. MySQL database volume name information. Additionally it is possible to specify SSL certificates for HTTPS support in *Secret*.\n### MySQL credentials\n```\nkind: Secret\napiVersion: v1\nmetadata:\n  name: zabbix-full-secrets\ndata:\n  mysql_root_password: emFiYml4X3N1cGVyX3Jvb3Q= [1]\n  mysql_zabbix_password: emFiYml4X3VzZXJfcGFzc3dvcmQ= [2]\n  mysql_zabbix_username: emFiYml4 [3]\ntype: Opaque\n```\nUsing MySQL root password (*mysqlrootpassword* [1]) Zabbix server / proxy will try to create MySQL database schema with grant permissions to *mysqlzabbixusername* [2] and *mysqlzabbixpassword* [3].\n### SSL certificates for HTTPS\n```\nkind: Secret\napiVersion: v1\nmetadata:\n  name: zabbix-web-sslsecret\ndata:\n  ssl.crt: >-\n   < ssl.crt data>\n  ssl.key: >-\n\t < ssl.key data >\n  dhparam.pem: >-\n   <  dhparam.pem data >\n```\nFiles *ssl.crt*, *ssl.key* and *dhparam.perm* are required for Zabbix web-interface for SSL support.\n",

      "csv_description": "# Instana\n\nInstana is an [APM solution](https://www.instana.com/product-overview/) built for microservices that enables IT Ops to build applications faster and deliver higher quality services by automating monitoring, tracing and root cause analysis. The solution is optimized for [Kubernetes](https://www.instana.com/automatic-kubernetes-monitoring/) and [OpenShift](https://www.instana.com/blog/automatic-root-cause-analysis-for-openshift-applications/).\n\n## Instana Agent Operator\n\nThis is the Kubernetes Operator for installing the Instana Agent on Kubernetes or OpenShift.\n\n## Prerequisites for OpenShift\n\nBefore the agent will be able to run in OpenShift, you need to perform a couple of extra configuration steps.\n\nYou need to set up a project for the Instana Agent and configure it's permissions.\n\nThe project you create here needs to be the namespace where you create the Instana Agent custom resource that the operator will use to deploy the agent.\n\nFor example, create the `instana-agent` project:\n\n    oc new-project instana-agent\n\nThen, ensure the `instana-agent` service account is in the privileged security context:\n\n    oc adm policy add-scc-to-user privileged -z instana-agent\n\nThis service account will be created by the operator.\n\nNow you can proceed with installing the operator for the Instana agent.\n\n## Installation and Configuration\n\nFirst, install this operator from [OperatorHub.io](https://operatorhub.io/), [OpenShift Container Platform](https://www.openshift.com/), or [OKD](https://www.okd.io/).\n\nSecond, create a custom resource with the agent configuration in the target namespace (for now, this MUST always be the `instana-agent` namespace). The operator will pick up the custom resource and install the Instana agent accordingly.\n\nThe following is a minimal template of the custom resource:\n\n```yaml\napiVersion: instana.io/v1\nkind: InstanaAgent\nmetadata:\n  name: instana-agent\n  namespace: instana-agent\nspec:\n  zone:\n    name: my-zone # (optional) name of the zone of the host\n  cluster:\n    name: replace-me # replace with the name of your Kubernetes cluster\n  agent:\n    key: replace-me # replace with your Instana agent key\n    endpointHost: ingress-red-saas.instana.io # the monitoring ingress endpoint\n    endpointPort: \"443\" # the monitoring ingress endpoint port, wrapped in quotes\n    env:\n      INSTANA_AGENT_TAGS: example\n    configuration_yaml: |\n      # You can leave this empty, or use this to configure your instana agent.\n      # See https://docs.instana.io/setup_and_manage/host_agent/on/kubernetes/\n```\n\nSave the template in a file `instana-agent.yaml` and edit the following values:\n\n* If your target namespace is not `instana-agent`, replace the `namespace:` accordingly.\n* `agent.key` must be set with your Instana agent key.\n* `agent.endpointHost` must be set with the monitoring ingress endpoint, generally either `saas-us-west-2.instana.io` or `saas-eu-west-1.instana.io`.\n* `agent.endpointPort` must be set with the monitoring ingress port, generally \"443\" (wrapped in quotes).\n* `zone.name` should be set with the name of the Kubernetes cluster that is be displayed in Instana.\n\nFor advanced configuration, you can edit the contents of the `configuration.yaml` file. View documentation [here](https://docs.instana.io/setup_and_manage/host_agent/on/kubernetes/).\n\nApply the custom resource with `kubectl apply -f instana-agent.yaml`. After some time, you should see `instana-agent` Pods being created on each node of your cluster, and your cluster should show on the infrastructure map on your Instana Web interface.\n\n## Uninstalling\n\nIn order to uninstall the Instana agent, simply remove the custom resource with `kubectl delete -f instana-agent.yaml`.\n\n## Source Code\n\nThe Instana agent operator is an open source project hosted on [https://github.com/instana/instana-agent-operator](https://github.com/instana/instana-agent-operator/).\n",

The solution is optimized for [Kubernetes](https://www.instana.com/automatic-kubernetes-monitoring/) and [OpenShift](https://www.instana.com/blog/automatic-root-cause-analysis-for-openshift-applications/).\n\n## Instana Agent Operator\n\nThis is the Kubernetes Operator for installing the Instana Agent on Kubernetes or OpenShift.\n\n## Prerequisites for OpenShift\n\nBefore the agent will be able to run in OpenShift, you need to perform a couple of extra configuration steps.\n\nYou need to set up a project for the Instana Agent and configure it's permissions.\n\nThe project you create here needs to be the namespace where you create the Instana Agent custom resource that the operator will use to deploy the agent.\n\nFor example, create the `instana-agent` project:\n\n    oc new-project instana-agent\n\nThen, ensure the `instana-agent` service account is in the privileged security context:\n\n    oc adm policy add-scc-to-user privileged -z instana-agent\n\nThis service account will be created by the operator.\n\nNow you can proceed with installing the operator for the Instana agent.\n\n## Installation and Configuration\n\nFirst, install this operator from [OperatorHub.io](https://operatorhub.io/), [OpenShift Container Platform](https://www.openshift.com/), or [OKD](https://www.okd.io/).\n\nSecond, create a custom resource with the agent configuration in the target namespace (for now, this MUST always be the `instana-agent` namespace). The operator will pick up the custom resource and install the Instana agent accordingly.\n\nThe following is a minimal template of the custom resource:\n\n```yaml\napiVersion: instana.io/v1\nkind: InstanaAgent\nmetadata:\n  name: instana-agent\n  namespace: instana-agent\nspec:\n  zone:\n    name: my-zone # (optional) name of the zone of the host\n  cluster:\n    name: replace-me # replace with the name of your Kubernetes cluster\n  agent:\n    key: replace-me # replace with your Instana agent key\n    endpointHost: ingress-red-saas.instana.io # the monitoring ingress endpoint\n    endpointPort: \"443\" # the monitoring ingress endpoint port, wrapped in quotes\n    env:\n      INSTANA_AGENT_TAGS: example\n    configuration_yaml: |\n      # You can leave this empty, or use this to configure your instana agent.\n      # See https://docs.instana.io/setup_and_manage/host_agent/on/kubernetes/\n```\n\nSave the template in a file `instana-agent.yaml` and edit the following values:\n\n* If your target namespace is not `instana-agent`, replace the `namespace:` accordingly.\n* `agent.key` must be set with your Instana agent key.\n* `agent.endpointHost` must be set with the monitoring ingress endpoint, generally either `saas-us-west-2.instana.io` or `saas-eu-west-1.instana.io`.\n* `agent.endpointPort` must be set with the monitoring ingress port, generally \"443\" (wrapped in quotes).\n* `zone.name` should be set with the name of the Kubernetes cluster that is be displayed in Instana.\n\nFor advanced configuration, you can edit the contents of the `configuration.yaml` file. View documentation [here](https://docs.instana.io/setup_and_manage/host_agent/on/kubernetes/).\n\nApply the custom resource with `kubectl apply -f instana-agent.yaml`. After some time, you should see `instana-agent` Pods being created on each node of your cluster, and your cluster should show on the infrastructure map on your Instana Web interface.\n\n## Uninstalling\n\nIn order to uninstall the Instana agent, simply remove the custom resource with `kubectl delete -f instana-agent.yaml`.\n\n## Source Code\n\nThe Instana agent operator is an open source project hosted on [https://github.com/instana/instana-agent-operator](https://github.com/instana/instana-agent-operator/).\n",

However, configuring and managing nodes with these hardware resources requires configuration of multiple software components such as drivers, container runtimes or other libraries which are difficult and prone to errors.\nThe NVIDIA GPU Operator uses the [operator framework](https://coreos.com/blog/introducing-operator-framework) within Kubernetes to automate the management of all NVIDIA software components needed to provision and monitor GPUs. These components include the NVIDIA drivers (to enable CUDA), Kubernetes device plugin for GPUs, the NVIDIA Container Runtime, automatic node labelling and NVIDIA DCGM exporter.\nVisit the official site of the [GPU Operator](https://github.com/NVIDIA/gpu-operator) for more information. For getting started with using the GPU Operator with OpenShift, see the instructions [here](https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/cloud-native/gpu-operator/openshift/contents.html).\n",

This capability allows to monitor both the Kubernetes Infrastructure ( like Node, Pods, Containers, Cluster Services etc ) and applications running on this infrastructure & correlate them together which can help the triager to isolate if the the problem is related to the application or infrastructure\n\n**Usage**:\n```\n apiVersion: ca.broadcom.com/v1alpha1\n kind: UniversalMonitoringAgent\n metadata:\n   name: uma-monitor\n spec:\n   # The agent and Enterprise Manager connection details.\n   agentManager:\n     url: localhost:5001\n     # Agent/EM login credentials.\n     credential:\n\n   clusterName: DevelopmentCluster\n   # type should be Kubernetes or Openshift depending on the environment\n   type: Openshift\n   role: common\n   monitor:\n     application:\n       # autoattach properties\n       autoattach:\n         filterType: whitelist\n         probe:\n           enabled: true\n         # this feature leverages container metadata to resolve agent host name and agent name\n         dynamicPropertyResolution:\n           hostName: \"{k8s_deployment_name},{k8s_daemonset_name},{k8s_deploymentconfig_name},{k8s_pod_name},ContainerHost\"\n           agentName: \"\"\n         # java autoattach properties\n         java:\n           enabled: true\n           propertiesOverride:\n           customJdkTools:\n             enabled: false\n             # Provide your custom created jdk tools jar image name below.\n             imageName:\n         # dotnet autoattach properties\n         dotnet:\n           enabled: true\n           propertiesOverride:\n       jmx:\n         enabled: true\n       opentracing:\n         enabled: true\n         grpc:\n           hostport:\n         correlation:\n           enabled: false\n       zipkinTracing:\n         enabled: true\n         zipkinServer:\n           hostport:\n     httpCollector:\n       enabled: true\n       replicas: 1\n       server:\n         host: 0.0.0.0\n         port: 8085\n         minMemory:\n         maxMemory:\n       memoryGrid:\n         enabled:\n       # Enable this ingress resource creation if there is Ingress Controller deployed\n       # It requires session affinity using HTTP Headers by LB Ingress Controller\n       ingress:\n         enabled: false\n         host:\n         ssl:\n           enabled: false\n     container:\n       prometheus:\n         exporter:\n           enabled: true\n         backend:\n           enabled: false\n           endPoint:\n             # Defines the URL endpoint of the Prometheus backend.\n             url:\n             # Username (if any) for connecting to the Prometheus backend URL.\n             username:\n             password:\n             # Token (if any) for connecting to the Prometheus backend URL.\n             token:\n             configFiles:\n             metricAlias: container_name=container,pod_name=pod\n           filter:\n             name:\n             value:\n\n       dockerstats:\n         enabled: true\n     clusterPerformance:\n       enabled: true\n     node:\n       enabled: true\n     kafka:\n       enabled: false\n       consumergroups:\n         metrics: true\n         filter: \"\"\n       jmx:\n         modules: \"kafka,jvm,memory\"\n         MBeans:\n         # A semi-colon separated list of managed bean object names.

This capability allows to monitor both the Kubernetes Infrastructure ( like Node, Pods, Containers, Cluster Services etc ) and applications running on this infrastructure & correlate them together which can help the triager to isolate if the the problem is related to the application or infrastructure\n\n**Usage**:\n```\n apiVersion: ca.broadcom.com/v1alpha1\n kind: UniversalMonitoringAgent\n metadata:\n   name: uma-monitor\n spec:\n   # The agent and Enterprise Manager connection details.\n   agentManager:\n     url: localhost:5001\n     # Agent/EM login credentials.\n     credential:\n\n   clusterName: DevelopmentCluster\n   # type should be Kubernetes or Openshift depending on the environment\n   type: Openshift\n   role: common\n   monitor:\n     application:\n       # autoattach properties\n       autoattach:\n         filterType: whitelist\n         probe:\n           enabled: true\n         # this feature leverages container metadata to resolve agent host name and agent name\n         dynamicPropertyResolution:\n           hostName: \"{k8s_deployment_name},{k8s_daemonset_name},{k8s_deploymentconfig_name},{k8s_pod_name},ContainerHost\"\n           agentName: \"\"\n         # java autoattach properties\n         java:\n           enabled: true\n           propertiesOverride:\n           customJdkTools:\n             enabled: false\n             # Provide your custom created jdk tools jar image name below.\n             imageName:\n         # dotnet autoattach properties\n         dotnet:\n           enabled: true\n           propertiesOverride:\n       jmx:\n         enabled: true\n       opentracing:\n         enabled: true\n         grpc:\n           hostport:\n         correlation:\n           enabled: false\n       zipkinTracing:\n         enabled: true\n         zipkinServer:\n           hostport:\n     httpCollector:\n       enabled: true\n       replicas: 1\n       server:\n         host: 0.0.0.0\n         port: 8085\n         minMemory:\n         maxMemory:\n       memoryGrid:\n         enabled:\n       # Enable this ingress resource creation if there is Ingress Controller deployed\n       # It requires session affinity using HTTP Headers by LB Ingress Controller\n       ingress:\n         enabled: false\n         host:\n         ssl:\n           enabled: false\n     container:\n       prometheus:\n         exporter:\n           enabled: true\n         backend:\n           enabled: false\n           endPoint:\n             # Defines the URL endpoint of the Prometheus backend.\n             url:\n             # Username (if any) for connecting to the Prometheus backend URL.\n             username:\n             password:\n             # Token (if any) for connecting to the Prometheus backend URL.\n             token:\n             configFiles:\n             metricAlias: container_name=container,pod_name=pod\n           filter:\n             name:\n             value:\n\n       dockerstats:\n         enabled: true\n     clusterPerformance:\n       enabled: true\n     node:\n       enabled: true\n     kafka:\n       enabled: false\n       consumergroups:\n         metrics: true\n         filter: \"\"\n       jmx:\n         modules: \"kafka,jvm,memory\"\n         MBeans:\n         # A semi-colon separated list of managed bean object names.

The MANTA Flow Container will specify the memory and cpu requirements for both request and limits. Also, the minimum storage requirements are specified for the persistent volumes (PVs).\n\n### MANTA Flow license.key\nValid license.key needs to be provided in order to successfully launch MANTA Flow Container.\n\n## MANTA Flow Deployment\n\n### Secrets\nCreate a secret for MANTA Flow license.key by:\n    \n    oc create secret generic mantaflow-keys --from-file=<path to license.key>/license.key\n\nCreate an initial admin credentials `username` and `password` and a MANTA master password, which is used for encryption of sensitive data in the persistent storage.\n\n    oc create secret generic mantaflow-credentials --from-literal=username=<manta admin username> --from-literal=password=<manta admin password> --from-literal=MANTA_MASTERPASSWORD=<password for encryption>\n\n### Create MANTA Auth Custom Resource\nCreate a MANTA Auth custom resource. Please use the default parameters provided by the operator and the name of the keys above.\n\n### Create MANTA Flow Custom Resource\nCreate a MANTA Flow custom resource. Please use the default parameters provided by the operator and the name of the keys above.\n\n## Scaling\nMANTA Flow currently supports scaling to zero. This means you can set `replicas: 0` in MANTA Flow Custom Resource Definition (CRD) and MANTA Flow container will be stopped.\n\nBy setting `replicas: 1` MANTA Flow will be scaled to be running on 1 container.

MANTA performs code scanning for lineage that is illustrated to the detailed attribute level with transformations.   Extreme color coding and filtering to make lineage consumable.  Also includes time-slicing for historical lineage analysis.\n\n## Features\n* **Create/Destroy**: Launch MANTA Flow Container deployment.\n* **Scaling to zero**: Scale down the deployment (turn off the container).\n\n## Prerequisites and Requirements\n### MANTA Flow Namespace\nMANTA should be installed into its own namespace.\n\nFor additional installation documentation see a [MANTA Flow Container documentation](https://mantatools.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/MTKB/pages/2450620467/MANTA+Flow+Container)\nin the MANTA Flow Knowledge Base.\n\n### MANTA Flow Operator\nThe MANTA Flow Operator is responsible for deployment and management of MANTA Flow container deployment.\n\n### Memory Considerations\nMANTA Flow is a memory intensive application. The MANTA Flow Container will specify the memory and cpu requirements for both request and limits. Also, the minimum storage requirements are specified for the persistent volumes (PVs).\n\n### MANTA Flow license.key\nValid license.key needs to be provided in order to successfully launch MANTA Flow Container.\n\n## MANTA Flow Deployment\n\n### Secrets\nCreate a secret for MANTA Flow license.key by:\n    \n    oc create secret generic mantaflow-keys --from-file=<path to license.key>/license.key\n\nCreate an initial admin credentials `username` and `password` and a MANTA master password, which is used for encryption of sensitive data in the persistent storage.\n\n    oc create secret generic mantaflow-credentials --from-literal=username=<manta admin username> --from-literal=password=<manta admin password> --from-literal=MANTA_MASTERPASSWORD=<password for encryption>\n\n### Create MANTA Auth Custom Resource\nCreate a MANTA Auth custom resource. Please use the default parameters provided by the operator and the name of the keys above.\n\n### Create MANTA Flow Custom Resource\nCreate a MANTA Flow custom resource. Please use the default parameters provided by the operator and the name of the keys above.\n\n## Scaling\nMANTA Flow currently supports scaling to zero. This means you can set `replicas: 0` in MANTA Flow Custom Resource Definition (CRD) and MANTA Flow container will be stopped.\n\nBy setting `replicas: 1` MANTA Flow will be scaled to be running on 1 container. All other values of `replicas` are considered invalid.\n",

It enables enterprise architects to govern the way their applications get deployed & managed in the cluster, while dramatically reducing the learning curve for developers to deploy into Kubernetes - allowing them to focus on writing the code!\nHere are some key features:\n\n#### Application Lifecyle\nYou can deploy your runtime component container by either pointing to a container image, or an OpenShift ImageStream. When using an ImageStream the Operator will watch for any updates and will re-deploy the modified image.\n\n#### Custom RBAC\nThis Operator is capable of using a custom ServiceAccount from the caller, allowing it to follow RBAC restrictions. By default it creates a ServiceAccount if one is not specified, which can also be bound with specific roles.\n\n#### Environment Configuration\nYou can configure a variety of artifacts with your deployment, such as: labels, annotations, and environment variables from a ConfigMap, a Secret or a value.\n\n#### Routing\nExpose your application to external users via a single toggle to create a Route on OpenShift or an Ingress on other Kubernetes environments. Advanced configuration, such as TLS settings, are also easily enabled.\n\n#### High Availability via Horizontal Pod Autoscaling\nRun multiple instances of your application for high availability. Either specify a static number of replicas or easily configure horizontal auto scaling to create (and delete) instances based on resource consumption.\n\n#### Persistence and advanced storage\nEnable persistence for your application by specifying simple requirements: just tell us the size of the storage and where you would like it to be mounted and we will create and manage that storage for you.\nThis toggles a StatefulSet resource instead of a Deployment resource, so your container can recover transactions and state upon a pod restart.\nWe offer an advanced mode where you can specify a built-in PersistentVolumeClaim, allowing you to configure many details of the persistent volume, such as its storage class and access mode.\n\n#### Service Binding\nYour runtime components can expose services by a simple toggle. We take care of the heavy lifting such as creating kubernetes Secrets with information other services can use to bind. We also keep the bindable information synchronized, so your applications can dynamically reconnect to its required services without any intervention or interruption.\n\n#### Exposing metrics to Prometheus\nThe Runtime Component Operator exposes the runtime container's metrics via the Prometheus Operator.\nYou can pick between a basic mode, where you simply specify the label that Prometheus is watching to scrape the metrics from the container, or you can specify the full `ServiceMonitor` spec embedded into the RuntimeComponent's `spec.monitoring` field to control configurations such as the poll interval and security credentials.\n\n#### Easily mount logs and transaction directories\nIf you need to mount the logs and transaction data from your runtime component to an external volume such as NFS (or any storage supported in your cluster), simply add the following (to specify the volume size and the location to persist) to your RuntimeComponent CR:\n``` storage: size: 2Gi mountPath: \"/logs\" ```\n\n#### Integration with OpenShift Serverless\nDeploy your serverless runtime component using a single toggle.  The Operator will convert all of its generated resources into [Knative](https://knative.dev) resources, allowing your pod to automatically scale to 0 when it is idle.\n\n#### Integration with OpenShift's Topology UI\nWe set the corresponding labels to support OpenShift's Developer Topology UI, which allows you to visualize your entire set of deployments and how they are connected.\n\nSee our [**documentation**](https://github.com/application-stacks/runtime-component-operator/tree/main/doc/) for more information.\n",

It enables enterprise architects to govern the way their applications get deployed & managed in the cluster, while dramatically reducing the learning curve for developers to deploy into Kubernetes - allowing them to focus on writing the code!\nHere are some key features:\n\n#### Application Lifecyle\nYou can deploy your runtime component container by either pointing to a container image, or an OpenShift ImageStream. When using an ImageStream the Operator will watch for any updates and will re-deploy the modified image.\n\n#### Custom RBAC\nThis Operator is capable of using a custom ServiceAccount from the caller, allowing it to follow RBAC restrictions. By default it creates a ServiceAccount if one is not specified, which can also be bound with specific roles.\n\n#### Environment Configuration\nYou can configure a variety of artifacts with your deployment, such as: labels, annotations, and environment variables from a ConfigMap, a Secret or a value.\n\n#### Routing\nExpose your application to external users via a single toggle to create a Route on OpenShift or an Ingress on other Kubernetes environments. Advanced configuration, such as TLS settings, are also easily enabled.\n\n#### High Availability via Horizontal Pod Autoscaling\nRun multiple instances of your application for high availability. Either specify a static number of replicas or easily configure horizontal auto scaling to create (and delete) instances based on resource consumption.\n\n#### Persistence and advanced storage\nEnable persistence for your application by specifying simple requirements: just tell us the size of the storage and where you would like it to be mounted and we will create and manage that storage for you.\nThis toggles a StatefulSet resource instead of a Deployment resource, so your container can recover transactions and state upon a pod restart.\nWe offer an advanced mode where you can specify a built-in PersistentVolumeClaim, allowing you to configure many details of the persistent volume, such as its storage class and access mode.\n\n#### Service Binding\nYour runtime components can expose services by a simple toggle. We take care of the heavy lifting such as creating kubernetes Secrets with information other services can use to bind. We also keep the bindable information synchronized, so your applications can dynamically reconnect to its required services without any intervention or interruption.\n\n#### Exposing metrics to Prometheus\nThe Runtime Component Operator exposes the runtime container's metrics via the Prometheus Operator.\nYou can pick between a basic mode, where you simply specify the label that Prometheus is watching to scrape the metrics from the container, or you can specify the full `ServiceMonitor` spec embedded into the RuntimeComponent's `spec.monitoring` field to control configurations such as the poll interval and security credentials.\n\n#### Easily mount logs and transaction directories\nIf you need to mount the logs and transaction data from your runtime component to an external volume such as NFS (or any storage supported in your cluster), simply add the following (to specify the volume size and the location to persist) to your RuntimeComponent CR:\n``` storage: size: 2Gi mountPath: \"/logs\" ```\n\n#### Integration with OpenShift Serverless\nDeploy your serverless runtime component using a single toggle.  The Operator will convert all of its generated resources into [Knative](https://knative.dev) resources, allowing your pod to automatically scale to 0 when it is idle.\n\n#### Integration with OpenShift's Topology UI\nWe set the corresponding labels to support OpenShift's Developer Topology UI, which allows you to visualize your entire set of deployments and how they are connected.\n\nSee our [**documentation**](https://github.com/application-stacks/runtime-component-operator/tree/main/doc/) for more information.\n",

It enables enterprise architects to govern the way their applications get deployed & managed in the cluster, while dramatically reducing the learning curve for developers to deploy into Kubernetes - allowing them to focus on writing the code!\nHere are some key features:\n\n#### Application Lifecyle\nYou can deploy your runtime component container by either pointing to a container image, or an OpenShift ImageStream. When using an ImageStream the Operator will watch for any updates and will re-deploy the modified image.\n\n#### Custom RBAC\nThis Operator is capable of using a custom ServiceAccount from the caller, allowing it to follow RBAC restrictions. By default it creates a ServiceAccount if one is not specified, which can also be bound with specific roles.\n\n#### Environment Configuration\nYou can configure a variety of artifacts with your deployment, such as: labels, annotations, and environment variables from a ConfigMap, a Secret or a value.\n\n#### Routing\nExpose your application to external users via a single toggle to create a Route on OpenShift or an Ingress on other Kubernetes environments. Advanced configuration, such as TLS settings, are also easily enabled.\n\n#### High Availability via Horizontal Pod Autoscaling\nRun multiple instances of your application for high availability. Either specify a static number of replicas or easily configure horizontal auto scaling to create (and delete) instances based on resource consumption.\n\n#### Persistence and advanced storage\nEnable persistence for your application by specifying simple requirements: just tell us the size of the storage and where you would like it to be mounted and we will create and manage that storage for you.\nThis toggles a StatefulSet resource instead of a Deployment resource, so your container can recover transactions and state upon a pod restart.\nWe offer an advanced mode where you can specify a built-in PersistentVolumeClaim, allowing you to configure many details of the persistent volume, such as its storage class and access mode.\n\n#### Service Binding\nYour runtime components can expose services by a simple toggle. We take care of the heavy lifting such as creating kubernetes Secrets with information other services can use to bind. We also keep the bindable information synchronized, so your applications can dynamically reconnect to its required services without any intervention or interruption.\n\n#### Exposing metrics to Prometheus\nThe Runtime Component Operator exposes the runtime container's metrics via the Prometheus Operator.\nYou can pick between a basic mode, where you simply specify the label that Prometheus is watching to scrape the metrics from the container, or you can specify the full `ServiceMonitor` spec embedded into the RuntimeComponent's `spec.monitoring` field to control configurations such as the poll interval and security credentials.\n\n#### Easily mount logs and transaction directories\nIf you need to mount the logs and transaction data from your runtime component to an external volume such as NFS (or any storage supported in your cluster), simply add the following (to specify the volume size and the location to persist) to your RuntimeComponent CR:\n``` storage: size: 2Gi mountPath: \"/logs\" ```\n\n#### Integration with OpenShift Serverless\nDeploy your serverless runtime component using a single toggle.  The Operator will convert all of its generated resources into [Knative](https://knative.dev) resources, allowing your pod to automatically scale to 0 when it is idle.\n\n#### Integration with OpenShift's Topology UI\nWe set the corresponding labels to support OpenShift's Developer Topology UI, which allows you to visualize your entire set of deployments and how they are connected.\n\nSee our [**documentation**](https://github.com/application-stacks/runtime-component-operator/tree/main/doc/) for more information.\n",

      "csv_description": "This advanced Operator can be used to deploy and manage Open Liberty applications with consistent, production-grade QoS. This operator is based on the [Runtime Component Operator](https://github.com/application-stacks/runtime-component-operator) and provides all of its capabilities in addition to Open Liberty specific features such as gathering traces and dumps (Day-2 operations) and easily configuring and managing the single sign-on information for your Open Liberty applications.\n\nOpen Liberty Operator enables enterprise architects to govern the way their applications get deployed & managed in the cluster, while dramatically reducing the learning curve for developers to deploy into Kubernetes - allowing them to focus on writing the code!\n\nHere are some key features:\n\n#### Application Lifecyle\nYou can deploy your Open Liberty application container by either pointing to a container image, or an OpenShift ImageStream. When using an ImageStream the Operator will watch for any updates and will re-deploy the modified image.\n\n#### Custom RBAC\nThis Operator is capable of using a custom ServiceAccount from the caller, allowing it to follow RBAC restrictions. By default it creates a ServiceAccount if one is not specified, which can also be bound with specific roles.\n\n#### Environment Configuration\nYou can configure a variety of artifacts with your deployment, such as: labels, annotations, and environment variables from a ConfigMap, a Secret or a value.\n\n#### Routing\nExpose your application to external users via a single toggle to create a Route on OpenShift or an Ingress on other Kubernetes environments.

We take care of the heavy lifting such as creating kubernetes Secrets with information other services can use to bind. We also keep the bindable information synchronized, so your applications can dynamically reconnect to its required services without any intervention or interruption.\n\n#### Single Sign-On (SSO)\nOpen Liberty provides capabilities to delegate authentication to external providers. Your application users can log in using their existing social media credentials from providers such as Google, Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter, GitHub, and any OpenID Connect (OIDC) or OAuth 2.0 clients. Open Liberty Operator allows to easily configure and manage the single sign-on information for your applications.\n\n#### Exposing metrics to Prometheus\nExpose the Open Liberty application's metrics via the Prometheus Operator.\nYou can pick between a basic mode, where you simply specify the label that Prometheus is watching to scrape the metrics from the container, or you can specify the full `ServiceMonitor` spec embedded into the OpenLibertyApplication's `spec.monitoring` field to control configurations such as poll interval and security credentials.\n\n#### Easily mount logs and transaction directories\nDo you need to mount the logs and transaction data from your application to an external volume such as NFS (or any storage supported in your cluster)? Simply add the following configuration (to specify the volume size and the location to persist) to your OpenLibertyApplication CR:\n``` storage: size: 2Gi mountPath: \"/logs\" ```\n\n#### Integration with OpenShift Serverless\nDeploy your serverless runtime component using a single toggle.  The Operator will convert all of its generated resources into [Knative](https://knative.dev) resources, allowing your pod to automatically scale to 0 when it is idle.\n\n#### Integration with OpenShift's Topology UI\nWe set the corresponding labels to support OpenShift's Developer Topology UI, which allows you to visualize your entire set of deployments and how they are connected.\n\nSee our [**documentation**](https://github.com/OpenLiberty/open-liberty-operator/tree/main/doc/) for more information.\n",

This operator is based on the [Runtime Component Operator](https://github.com/application-stacks/runtime-component-operator) and provides all of its capabilities in addition to Open Liberty specific features such as gathering traces and dumps (Day-2 operations) and easily configuring and managing the single sign-on information for your Open Liberty applications.\n\nOpen Liberty Operator enables enterprise architects to govern the way their applications get deployed & managed in the cluster, while dramatically reducing the learning curve for developers to deploy into Kubernetes - allowing them to focus on writing the code!\n\nHere are some key features:\n\n#### Application Lifecyle\nYou can deploy your Open Liberty application container by either pointing to a container image, or an OpenShift ImageStream. When using an ImageStream the Operator will watch for any updates and will re-deploy the modified image.\n\n#### Custom RBAC\nThis Operator is capable of using a custom ServiceAccount from the caller, allowing it to follow RBAC restrictions. By default it creates a ServiceAccount if one is not specified, which can also be bound with specific roles.\n\n#### Environment Configuration\nYou can configure a variety of artifacts with your deployment, such as: labels, annotations, and environment variables from a ConfigMap, a Secret or a value.\n\n#### Routing\nExpose your application to external users via a single toggle to create a Route on OpenShift or an Ingress on other Kubernetes environments. Advanced configuration, such as TLS settings, are also easily enabled.\n\n#### High Availability via Horizontal Pod Autoscaling\nRun multiple instances of your application for high availability. Either specify a static number of replicas or easily configure horizontal auto scaling to create (and delete) instances based on resource consumption.\n\n#### Persistence and advanced storage\nEnable persistence for your application by specifying simple requirements: just tell us the size of the storage and where you would like it to be mounted and we will create and manage that storage for you.\nThis toggles a StatefulSet resource instead of a Deployment resource, so your container can recover transactions and state upon a pod restart.\nWe offer an advanced mode where you can specify a built-in PersistentVolumeClaim, allowing you to configure many details of the persistent volume, such as its storage class and access mode.\nYou can also easily configure and use a single storage for serviceability related Day-2 operations, such as gatherig server traces and dumps.\n\n#### Service Binding\nYour runtime components can expose services by a simple toggle. We take care of the heavy lifting such as creating kubernetes Secrets with information other services can use to bind. We also keep the bindable information synchronized, so your applications can dynamically reconnect to its required services without any intervention or interruption.\n\n#### Single Sign-On (SSO)\nOpen Liberty provides capabilities to delegate authentication to external providers. Your application users can log in using their existing social media credentials from providers such as Google, Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter, GitHub, and any OpenID Connect (OIDC) or OAuth 2.0 clients. Open Liberty Operator allows to easily configure and manage the single sign-on information for your applications.\n\n#### Exposing metrics to Prometheus\nExpose the Open Liberty application's metrics via the Prometheus Operator.\nYou can pick between a basic mode, where you simply specify the label that Prometheus is watching to scrape the metrics from the container, or you can specify the full `ServiceMonitor` spec embedded into the OpenLibertyApplication's `spec.monitoring` field to control configurations such as poll interval and security credentials.\n\n#### Easily mount logs and transaction directories\nDo you need to mount the logs and transaction data from your application to an external volume such as NFS (or any storage supported in your cluster)?

This operator is based on the [Runtime Component Operator](https://github.com/application-stacks/runtime-component-operator) and provides all of its capabilities in addition to Open Liberty specific features such as gathering traces and dumps (Day-2 operations) and easily configuring and managing the single sign-on information for your Open Liberty applications.\n\nOpen Liberty Operator enables enterprise architects to govern the way their applications get deployed & managed in the cluster, while dramatically reducing the learning curve for developers to deploy into Kubernetes - allowing them to focus on writing the code!\n\nHere are some key features:\n\n#### Application Lifecyle\nYou can deploy your Open Liberty application container by either pointing to a container image, or an OpenShift ImageStream. When using an ImageStream the Operator will watch for any updates and will re-deploy the modified image.\n\n#### Custom RBAC\nThis Operator is capable of using a custom ServiceAccount from the caller, allowing it to follow RBAC restrictions. By default it creates a ServiceAccount if one is not specified, which can also be bound with specific roles.\n\n#### Environment Configuration\nYou can configure a variety of artifacts with your deployment, such as: labels, annotations, and environment variables from a ConfigMap, a Secret or a value.\n\n#### Routing\nExpose your application to external users via a single toggle to create a Route on OpenShift or an Ingress on other Kubernetes environments. Advanced configuration, such as TLS settings, are also easily enabled.\n\n#### High Availability via Horizontal Pod Autoscaling\nRun multiple instances of your application for high availability. Either specify a static number of replicas or easily configure horizontal auto scaling to create (and delete) instances based on resource consumption.\n\n#### Persistence and advanced storage\nEnable persistence for your application by specifying simple requirements: just tell us the size of the storage and where you would like it to be mounted and we will create and manage that storage for you.\nThis toggles a StatefulSet resource instead of a Deployment resource, so your container can recover transactions and state upon a pod restart.\nWe offer an advanced mode where you can specify a built-in PersistentVolumeClaim, allowing you to configure many details of the persistent volume, such as its storage class and access mode.\nYou can also easily configure and use a single storage for serviceability related Day-2 operations, such as gatherig server traces and dumps.\n\n#### Service Binding\nYour runtime components can expose services by a simple toggle. We take care of the heavy lifting such as creating kubernetes Secrets with information other services can use to bind. We also keep the bindable information synchronized, so your applications can dynamically reconnect to its required services without any intervention or interruption.\n\n#### Single Sign-On (SSO)\nOpen Liberty provides capabilities to delegate authentication to external providers. Your application users can log in using their existing social media credentials from providers such as Google, Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter, GitHub, and any OpenID Connect (OIDC) or OAuth 2.0 clients. Open Liberty Operator allows to easily configure and manage the single sign-on information for your applications.\n\n#### Exposing metrics to Prometheus\nExpose the Open Liberty application's metrics via the Prometheus Operator.\nYou can pick between a basic mode, where you simply specify the label that Prometheus is watching to scrape the metrics from the container, or you can specify the full `ServiceMonitor` spec embedded into the OpenLibertyApplication's `spec.monitoring` field to control configurations such as poll interval and security credentials.\n\n#### Easily mount logs and transaction directories\nDo you need to mount the logs and transaction data from your application to an external volume such as NFS (or any storage supported in your cluster)? Simply add the following configuration (to specify the volume size and the location to persist) to your OpenLibertyApplication CR:\n``` storage: size: 2Gi mountPath: \"/logs\" ```\n\n#### Integration with OpenShift Serverless\nDeploy your serverless runtime component using a single toggle.  The Operator will convert all of its generated resources into [Knative](https://knative.dev) resources, allowing your pod to automatically scale to 0 when it is idle.\n\n#### Integration with OpenShift's Topology UI\nWe set the corresponding labels to support OpenShift's Developer Topology UI, which allows you to visualize your entire set of deployments and how they are connected.\n\nSee our [**documentation**](https://github.com/OpenLiberty/open-liberty-operator/tree/main/doc/) for more information.\n",

      "csv_description": "This advanced Operator can be used to deploy and manage Open Liberty applications with consistent, production-grade QoS. This operator is based on the [Runtime Component Operator](https://github.com/application-stacks/runtime-component-operator) and provides all of its capabilities in addition to Open Liberty specific features such as gathering traces and dumps (Day-2 operations) and easily configuring and managing the single sign-on information for your Open Liberty applications.\n\nOpen Liberty Operator enables enterprise architects to govern the way their applications get deployed & managed in the cluster, while dramatically reducing the learning curve for developers to deploy into Kubernetes - allowing them to focus on writing the code!\n\nHere are some key features:\n\n#### Application Lifecyle\nYou can deploy your Open Liberty application container by either pointing to a container image, or an OpenShift ImageStream. When using an ImageStream the Operator will watch for any updates and will re-deploy the modified image.\n\n#### Custom RBAC\nThis Operator is capable of using a custom ServiceAccount from the caller, allowing it to follow RBAC restrictions. By default it creates a ServiceAccount if one is not specified, which can also be bound with specific roles.\n\n#### Environment Configuration\nYou can configure a variety of artifacts with your deployment, such as: labels, annotations, and environment variables from a ConfigMap, a Secret or a value.\n\n#### Routing\nExpose your application to external users via a single toggle to create a Route on OpenShift or an Ingress on other Kubernetes environments. Advanced configuration, such as TLS settings, are also easily enabled.\n\n#### High Availability via Horizontal Pod Autoscaling\nRun multiple instances of your application for high availability. Either specify a static number of replicas or easily configure horizontal auto scaling to create (and delete) instances based on resource consumption.\n\n#### Persistence and advanced storage\nEnable persistence for your application by specifying simple requirements: just tell us the size of the storage and where you would like it to be mounted and we will create and manage that storage for you.\nThis toggles a StatefulSet resource instead of a Deployment resource, so your container can recover transactions and state upon a pod restart.\nWe offer an advanced mode where you can specify a built-in PersistentVolumeClaim, allowing you to configure many details of the persistent volume, such as its storage class and access mode.\nYou can also easily configure and use a single storage for serviceability related Day-2 operations, such as gatherig server traces and dumps.\n\n#### Service Binding\nYour runtime components can expose services by a simple toggle. We take care of the heavy lifting such as creating kubernetes Secrets with information other services can use to bind. We also keep the bindable information synchronized, so your applications can dynamically reconnect to its required services without any intervention or interruption.\n\n#### Single Sign-On (SSO)\nOpen Liberty provides capabilities to delegate authentication to external providers. Your application users can log in using their existing social media credentials from providers such as Google, Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter, GitHub, and any OpenID Connect (OIDC) or OAuth 2.0 clients. Open Liberty Operator allows to easily configure and manage the single sign-on information for your applications.\n\n#### Exposing metrics to Prometheus\nExpose the Open Liberty application's metrics via the Prometheus Operator.\nYou can pick between a basic mode, where you simply specify the label that Prometheus is watching to scrape the metrics from the container, or you can specify the full `ServiceMonitor` spec embedded into the OpenLibertyApplication's `spec.monitoring` field to control configurations such as poll interval and security credentials.\n\n#### Easily mount logs and transaction directories\nDo you need to mount the logs and transaction data from your application to an external volume such as NFS (or any storage supported in your cluster)? Simply add the following configuration (to specify the volume size and the location to persist) to your OpenLibertyApplication CR:\n``` storage: size: 2Gi mountPath: \"/logs\" ```\n\n#### Integration with OpenShift Serverless\nDeploy your serverless runtime component using a single toggle.  The Operator will convert all of its generated resources into [Knative](https://knative.dev) resources, allowing your pod to automatically scale to 0 when it is idle.\n\n#### Integration with OpenShift's Topology UI\nWe set the corresponding labels to support OpenShift's Developer Topology UI, which allows you to visualize your entire set of deployments and how they are connected.\n\nSee our [**documentation**](https://github.com/OpenLiberty/open-liberty-operator/tree/main/doc/) for more information.\n",

Replica sets provide redundancy and high\navailability, and are the basis for all production deployments. This section\nintroduces replication in MongoDB as well as the components and architecture\nof replica sets. The section also provides tutorials for common tasks\nrelated to replica sets.\n\n* Sharded Cluster: The set of nodes comprising a sharded MongoDB deployment.\nA sharded cluster consists of config servers, shards, and one or more mongos\nrouting processes. Sharding is a A database architecture that partitions\ndata by key ranges and distributes the data among two or more database\ninstances. Sharding enables horizontal scaling.\n\n## Requirements for deploying MongoDB OpsManager\n\n* In order to deploy resources of type MongoDB OpsManager, you will need to\ncreate a secret containing the [credentials](https://docs.mongodb.com/kubernetes-operator/stable/tutorial/plan-om-resource/#om-rsrc-prereqs)\nfor the Global Onwer user\n\n## Security ##\n\nThe operator can enable TLS for all traffic between servers and also between\nclients and servers. Before enabling `security.tls.enabled` to `true` you\nshould create your certificates.  or you can leave the operator to create all\nthe certificates for you.

Replica sets provide redundancy and high\navailability, and are the basis for all production deployments. This section\nintroduces replication in MongoDB as well as the components and architecture\nof replica sets. The section also provides tutorials for common tasks\nrelated to replica sets.\n\n* Sharded Cluster: The set of nodes comprising a sharded MongoDB deployment.\nA sharded cluster consists of config servers, shards, and one or more mongos\nrouting processes. Sharding is a A database architecture that partitions\ndata by key ranges and distributes the data among two or more database\ninstances. Sharding enables horizontal scaling.\n\n## Requirements for deploying MongoDB OpsManager\n\n* In order to deploy resources of type MongoDB OpsManager, you will need to\ncreate a secret containing the [credentials](https://docs.mongodb.com/kubernetes-operator/stable/tutorial/plan-om-resource/#om-rsrc-prereqs)\nfor the Global Onwer user\n\n## Security ##\n\nThe operator can enable TLS for all traffic between servers and also between\nclients and servers. Before enabling `security.tls.enabled` to `true` you\nshould create your certificates.  or you can leave the operator to create all\nthe certificates for you. The operator ability to create certs is been\ndepricted due to Kuberentes API changes.\n\nFor more information, please read the official MongoDB\nKubernetes Operator  [docs](https://docs.mongodb.com/kubernetes-operator/stable/).\n",

      "csv_description": "The Couchbase Autonomous Operator allows users to easily deploy, manage, and maintain Couchbase deployments on OpenShift. By installing this integration you will be able to deply Couchbase Server clusters with a single command.\n\n## Supported Features\n\n* **Automated cluster provisioning** - Deploying a Couchbase Cluster has never been easier. Fill out a Couchbase specific configuration and let the Couchbase Operator take care of provisioning nodes and setting up cluster to your exact specification.\n\n* **On-demand scalability** - Automatically scale your cluster up or down by changing a simple configuration parameter and let the Couchbase Operator handle provisioning of new nodes and joining them into the cluster.\n\n* **Auto-recovery** - Detect Couchbase node failures, rebalance out bad nodes, and bring the cluster back up to the desired capacity. Auto-recovery is completely automated so you can sleep easy through the night knowing that the Couchbase Operator will handle any failures.\n\n* **Geo-distribution** - Replicate your data between datacenters to move data closer to the users who consume it and protect against disaster scenarios where an entire datacenter becomes unavailable.\n\n* **Persistent storage** - Define persistent network-attached storage for each node in your cluster to allow pods to be recovered even if the node they were running on is no longer available.\n\n* **Rack/zone awareness** - Tell the Couchbase Operator about availability zones in your datacenter and let the operator take care of ensuring that nodes in your cluster are deployed equally across each zone.\n\n* **Supportability** - When things go wrong, use the cbopinfo tool provided with the Couchbase Operator to collect relevant data about your Couchbase deployment so that you can quickly address issues.\n\n* **Centralized configuration management** - Manage your configuration centrally with OpenShift. Updates to the configuration are watched by the Couchbase Operator and actions are taken to make the target cluster match the desired configuration.\n## Required Parameters\n* `authSecret` - provide the name of a secret that contains two keys for the `username` and `password` of the super user ([documentation](https://docs.couchbase.com/operator/1.2/couchbase-cluster-config.html))\n\n## About Couchbase Server\n\nBuilt on the most powerful NoSQL technology, Couchbase Server delivers unparalleled performance at scale, in any cloud. With features like memory-first architecture, geo-distributed deployments, and workload isolation, Couchbase Server excels at supporting mission-critical applications at scale while maintaining submillisecond latencies and 99.999% availability. Plus, with the most comprehensive SQL-compatible query language (N1QL), migrating from RDBMS to Couchbase Server is easy with ANSI joins.\n",

By installing this integration you will be able to deply Couchbase Server clusters with a single command.\n\n## Supported Features\n\n* **Automated cluster provisioning** - Deploying a Couchbase Cluster has never been easier. Fill out a Couchbase specific configuration and let the Couchbase Operator take care of provisioning nodes and setting up cluster to your exact specification.\n\n* **On-demand scalability** - Automatically scale your cluster up or down by changing a simple configuration parameter and let the Couchbase Operator handle provisioning of new nodes and joining them into the cluster.\n\n* **Auto-recovery** - Detect Couchbase node failures, rebalance out bad nodes, and bring the cluster back up to the desired capacity. Auto-recovery is completely automated so you can sleep easy through the night knowing that the Couchbase Operator will handle any failures.\n\n* **Geo-distribution** - Replicate your data between datacenters to move data closer to the users who consume it and protect against disaster scenarios where an entire datacenter becomes unavailable.\n\n* **Persistent storage** - Define persistent network-attached storage for each node in your cluster to allow pods to be recovered even if the node they were running on is no longer available.\n\n* **Rack/zone awareness** - Tell the Couchbase Operator about availability zones in your datacenter and let the operator take care of ensuring that nodes in your cluster are deployed equally across each zone.\n\n* **Supportability** - When things go wrong, use the cbopinfo tool provided with the Couchbase Operator to collect relevant data about your Couchbase deployment so that you can quickly address issues.\n\n* **Centralized configuration management** - Manage your configuration centrally with OpenShift. Updates to the configuration are watched by the Couchbase Operator and actions are taken to make the target cluster match the desired configuration.\n## Required Parameters\n* `authSecret` - provide the name of a secret that contains two keys for the `username` and `password` of the super user ([documentation](https://docs.couchbase.com/operator/1.2/couchbase-cluster-config.html))\n\n## About Couchbase Server\n\nBuilt on the most powerful NoSQL technology, Couchbase Server delivers unparalleled performance at scale, in any cloud. With features like memory-first architecture, geo-distributed deployments, and workload isolation, Couchbase Server excels at supporting mission-critical applications at scale while maintaining submillisecond latencies and 99.999% availability. Plus, with the most comprehensive SQL-compatible query language (N1QL), migrating from RDBMS to Couchbase Server is easy with ANSI joins.\n",

MANTA performs code scanning for lineage that is illustrated to the detailed attribute level with transformations.   Extreme color coding and filtering to make lineage consumable.  Also includes time-slicing for historical lineage analysis.\n\n## Features\n* **Create/Destroy**: Launch MANTA Flow Container deployment.\n* **Scaling to zero**: Scale down the deployment (turn off the container).\n\n## Prerequisites and Requirements\n### MANTA Flow Namespace\nMANTA should be installed into its own namespace.\n\nFor additional installation documentation see a [MANTA Flow Container documentation](https://mantatools.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/MTKB/pages/2450620467/MANTA+Flow+Container)\nin the MANTA Flow Knowledge Base.\n\n### MANTA Flow Operator\nThe MANTA Flow Operator is responsible for deployment and management of MANTA Flow container deployment.\n\n### Memory Considerations\nMANTA Flow is a memory intensive application. The MANTA Flow Container will specify the memory and cpu requirements for both request and limits. Also, the minimum storage requirements are specified for the persistent volumes (PVs).\n\n### MANTA Flow license.key\nValid license.key needs to be provided in order to successfully launch MANTA Flow Container.\n\n## MANTA Flow Deployment\n\n### Secrets\nCreate a secret for MANTA Flow license.key by:\n    \n    oc create secret generic mantaflow-keys --from-file=<path to license.key>/license.key\n\nCreate an initial admin credentials `username` and `password` and a MANTA master password, which is used for encryption of sensitive data in the persistent storage.\n\n    oc create secret generic mantaflow-credentials --from-literal=username=<manta admin username> --from-literal=password=<manta admin password> --from-literal=MANTA_MASTERPASSWORD=<password for encryption>\n\n### Create MANTA Auth Custom Resource\nCreate a MANTA Auth custom resource. Please use the default parameters provided by the operator and the name of the keys above.\n\n### Create MANTA Flow Custom Resource\nCreate a MANTA Flow custom resource. Please use the default parameters provided by the operator and the name of the keys above.\n\n## Scaling\nMANTA Flow currently supports scaling to zero. This means you can set `replicas: 0` in MANTA Flow Custom Resource Definition (CRD) and MANTA Flow container will be stopped.\n\nBy setting `replicas: 1` MANTA Flow will be scaled to be running on 1 container. All other values of `replicas` are considered invalid.\n",

MANTA performs code scanning for lineage that is illustrated to the detailed attribute level with transformations.   Extreme color coding and filtering to make lineage consumable.  Also includes time-slicing for historical lineage analysis.\n\n## Features\n* **Create/Destroy**: Launch MANTA Flow Container deployment.\n* **Scaling to zero**: Scale down the deployment (turn off the container).\n\n## Prerequisites and Requirements\n### MANTA Flow Namespace\nMANTA should be installed into its own namespace.\n\nFor additional installation documentation see a [MANTA Flow Container documentation](https://mantatools.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/MTKB/pages/2450620467/MANTA+Flow+Container)\nin the MANTA Flow Knowledge Base.\n\n### MANTA Flow Operator\nThe MANTA Flow Operator is responsible for deployment and management of MANTA Flow container deployment.\n\n### Memory Considerations\nMANTA Flow is a memory intensive application. The MANTA Flow Container will specify the memory and cpu requirements for both request and limits. Also, the minimum storage requirements are specified for the persistent volumes (PVs).\n\n### MANTA Flow license.key\nValid license.key needs to be provided in order to successfully launch MANTA Flow Container.\n\n## MANTA Flow Deployment\n\n### Secrets\nCreate a secret for MANTA Flow license.key by:\n    \n    oc create secret generic mantaflow-keys --from-file=<path to license.key>/license.key\n\nCreate an initial admin credentials `username` and `password` and a MANTA master password, which is used for encryption of sensitive data in the persistent storage.\n\n    oc create secret generic mantaflow-credentials --from-literal=username=<manta admin username> --from-literal=password=<manta admin password> --from-literal=MANTA_MASTERPASSWORD=<password for encryption>\n\n### Create MANTA Auth Custom Resource\nCreate a MANTA Auth custom resource. Please use the default parameters provided by the operator and the name of the keys above.\n\n### Create MANTA Flow Custom Resource\nCreate a MANTA Flow custom resource. Please use the default parameters provided by the operator and the name of the keys above.\n\n## Scaling\nMANTA Flow currently supports scaling to zero. This means you can set `replicas: 0` in MANTA Flow Custom Resource Definition (CRD) and MANTA Flow container will be stopped.\n\nBy setting `replicas: 1` MANTA Flow will be scaled to be running on 1 container. All other values of `replicas` are considered invalid.\n",

MANTA performs code scanning for lineage that is illustrated to the detailed attribute level with transformations.   Extreme color coding and filtering to make lineage consumable.  Also includes time-slicing for historical lineage analysis.\n\n## Features\n* **Create/Destroy**: Launch MANTA Flow Container deployment.\n* **Scaling to zero**: Scale down the deployment (turn off the container).\n\n## Prerequisites and Requirements\n### MANTA Flow Namespace\nMANTA should be installed into its own namespace.\n\nFor additional installation documentation see a [MANTA Flow Container documentation](https://mantatools.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/MTKB/pages/2450620467/MANTA+Flow+Container)\nin the MANTA Flow Knowledge Base.\n\n### MANTA Flow Operator\nThe MANTA Flow Operator is responsible for deployment and management of MANTA Flow container deployment.\n\n### Memory Considerations\nMANTA Flow is a memory intensive application. The MANTA Flow Container will specify the memory and cpu requirements for both request and limits. Also, the minimum storage requirements are specified for the persistent volumes (PVs).\n\n### MANTA Flow license.key\nValid license.key needs to be provided in order to successfully launch MANTA Flow Container.\n\n## MANTA Flow Deployment\n\n### Secrets\nCreate a secret for MANTA Flow license.key by:\n    \n    oc create secret generic mantaflow-keys --from-file=<path to license.key>/license.key\n\nCreate an initial admin credentials `username` and `password` and a MANTA master password, which is used for encryption of sensitive data in the persistent storage.\n\n    oc create secret generic mantaflow-credentials --from-literal=username=<manta admin username> --from-literal=password=<manta admin password> --from-literal=MANTA_MASTERPASSWORD=<password for encryption>\n\n### Create MANTA Auth Custom Resource\nCreate a MANTA Auth custom resource. Please use the default parameters provided by the operator and the name of the keys above.\n\n### Create MANTA Flow Custom Resource\nCreate a MANTA Flow custom resource. Please use the default parameters provided by the operator and the name of the keys above.\n\n## Scaling\nMANTA Flow currently supports scaling to zero. This means you can set `replicas: 0` in MANTA Flow Custom Resource Definition (CRD) and MANTA Flow container will be stopped.\n\nBy setting `replicas: 1` MANTA Flow will be scaled to be running on 1 container. All other values of `replicas` are considered invalid.\n",

      "csv_description": "The Aqua Security Operator runs within an OpenShift cluster and provides a means to deploy and manage the Aqua Security cluster and components :\n* Server (aka \u201cconsole\u201d)\n* Database (for production environments we recommend to use an external database and not the Aqua default database)\n* Gateway\n* Enforcer (aka \u201cagent\u201d)\n* KubeEnforcer\n* Scanner\n* CSP (package that contains the Server, Database, and Gateway)\n\nUse the Aqua-Operator to\n* Deploy Aqua Security components on OpenShift\n* Scale up Aqua Security components with extra replicas\n* Assign metadata tags to Aqua Security components\n\nThe Aqua Operator provides a few [Custom Resources](https://github.com/aquasecurity/aqua-operator/tree/master/deploy/crds) for managing the Aqua CSP platform.\n\n## Prerequisites\n\nThere are only 3 prerequisites:\n1. Make sure you have a license and to obtain one, please contact Aqua Security at [Contact Us](mailto:cloudsales@aquasec.com).\n2. Create a new project for aqua\n\n    ```oc new-project aqua```\n\n3. Create the secret for Aqua Database password. If you are using an External Database, make sure you use those credentials.\nNOTE: This step is optional and you can specify the Database password when creating the CRs.\n\n    ```oc create secret generic aqua-database-password --from-literal=db-password=<password> -n aqua```\n\nPlease note that for the certified operator, the Docker registry secret is NOT needed. For the Red Hat certified operator, the Aqua application images are stored in the Red Hat Connect registry and will be automatically pulled by the Aqua operator.\n\n## Choosing the right channel\n\nChannels are a flexible publishing mechanism that offers you three different Aqua versions to deploy, at any point. These channels map to their respective Aqua versions, describing the maturity based on where they are in their lifecycle:\n* 4.6: This maps to the older version of Aqua 4.6.0\n* 5.0: This maps to the Aqua version 5.0.0\n* 5.3: This maps to the Aqua version 5.3.0\n* 6.0: This maps to the Aqua version 6.0.0\n* 6.2: This maps to the Aqua version 6.2.0\n* 6.5: This is the latest and greatest version of Aqua (default)\n\n## Deploying the Aqua Operator\n\nAqua Operator follows an easy push button deployment that installs the operator in its own aqua namespace.\nPlease refer to the instructions [here](https://github.com/aquasecurity/aqua-operator/blob/6.2.0/docs/DeployOpenShiftOperator.md).\n\n## Configuring the Aqua Operator\n\nOperators leverage CRDs as a configuration mechanism for the application. Aqua offers a number of CRDs that can be tweaked and configured as per your needs. Please refer to this [link](https://github.com/aquasecurity/aqua-operator/blob/6.2.0/docs/DeployOpenShiftOperator.md#aquacsp-crds) for Custom Resource examples for popular scenarios.\n\n## Support\n\nFor support please contact support@aquasec.com.",

      "csv_description": "The Aqua Security Operator runs within an OpenShift cluster and provides a means to deploy and manage the Aqua Security cluster and components :\n* Server (aka \u201cconsole\u201d)\n* Database (for production environments we recommend to use an external database and not the Aqua default database)\n* Gateway\n* Enforcer (aka \u201cagent\u201d)\n* KubeEnforcer\n* Scanner\n* CSP (package that contains the Server, Database, and Gateway)\n\nUse the Aqua-Operator to\n* Deploy Aqua Security components on OpenShift\n* Scale up Aqua Security components with extra replicas\n* Assign metadata tags to Aqua Security components\n\nThe Aqua Operator provides a few [Custom Resources](https://github.com/aquasecurity/aqua-operator/tree/master/deploy/crds) for managing the Aqua CSP platform.\n\n## Prerequisites\n\nThere are only 3 prerequisites:\n1. Make sure you have a license and to obtain one, please contact Aqua Security at [Contact Us](mailto:cloudsales@aquasec.com).\n2. Create a new project for aqua\n\n    ```oc new-project aqua```\n\n3. Create the secret for Aqua Database password. If you are using an External Database, make sure you use those credentials.\nNOTE: This step is optional and you can specify the Database password when creating the CRs.\n\n    ```oc create secret generic aqua-database-password --from-literal=db-password=<password> -n aqua```\n\nPlease note that for the certified operator, the Docker registry secret is NOT needed. For the Red Hat certified operator, the Aqua application images are stored in the Red Hat Connect registry and will be automatically pulled by the Aqua operator.\n\n## Choosing the right channel\n\nChannels are a flexible publishing mechanism that offers you three different Aqua versions to deploy, at any point. These channels map to their respective Aqua versions, describing the maturity based on where they are in their lifecycle:\n* 4.6: This maps to the older version of Aqua 4.6.0\n* 5.0: This maps to the Aqua version 5.0.0\n* 5.3: This maps to the Aqua version 5.3.0\n* 6.0: This maps to the Aqua version 6.0.0\n* 6.2: This maps to the Aqua version 6.2.0\n* 6.5: This is the latest and greatest version of Aqua (default)\n\n## Deploying the Aqua Operator\n\nAqua Operator follows an easy push button deployment that installs the operator in its own aqua namespace.\nPlease refer to the instructions [here](https://github.com/aquasecurity/aqua-operator/blob/6.2.0/docs/DeployOpenShiftOperator.md).\n\n## Configuring the Aqua Operator\n\nOperators leverage CRDs as a configuration mechanism for the application. Aqua offers a number of CRDs that can be tweaked and configured as per your needs. Please refer to this [link](https://github.com/aquasecurity/aqua-operator/blob/6.2.0/docs/DeployOpenShiftOperator.md#aquacsp-crds) for Custom Resource examples for popular scenarios.\n\n## Support\n\nFor support please contact support@aquasec.com.",

      "csv_description": "The Aqua Security Operator runs within an OpenShift cluster and provides a means to deploy and manage the Aqua Security cluster and components :\n* Server (aka \u201cconsole\u201d)\n* Database (for production environments we recommend to use an external database and not the Aqua default database)\n* Gateway\n* Enforcer (aka \u201cagent\u201d)\n* KubeEnforcer\n* Scanner\n* CSP (package that contains the Server, Database, and Gateway)\n\nUse the Aqua-Operator to\n* Deploy Aqua Security components on OpenShift\n* Scale up Aqua Security components with extra replicas\n* Assign metadata tags to Aqua Security components\n\nThe Aqua Operator provides a few [Custom Resources](https://github.com/aquasecurity/aqua-operator/tree/master/deploy/crds) for managing the Aqua CSP platform.\n\n## Prerequisites\n\nThere are only 3 prerequisites:\n1. Make sure you have a license and to obtain one, please contact Aqua Security at [Contact Us](mailto:cloudsales@aquasec.com).\n2. Create a new project for aqua\n\n    ```oc new-project aqua```\n\n3. Create the secret for Aqua Database password. If you are using an External Database, make sure you use those credentials.\nNOTE: This step is optional and you can specify the Database password when creating the CRs.\n\n    ```oc create secret generic aqua-database-password --from-literal=db-password=<password> -n aqua```\n\nPlease note that for the certified operator, the Docker registry secret is NOT needed. For the Red Hat certified operator, the Aqua application images are stored in the Red Hat Connect registry and will be automatically pulled by the Aqua operator.\n\n## Choosing the right channel\n\nChannels are a flexible publishing mechanism that offers you three different Aqua versions to deploy, at any point. These channels map to their respective Aqua versions, describing the maturity based on where they are in their lifecycle:\n* 4.6: This maps to the older version of Aqua 4.6.0\n* 5.0: This maps to the Aqua version 5.0.0\n* 5.3: This maps to the Aqua version 5.3.0\n* 6.0: This maps to the Aqua version 6.0.0\n* 6.2: This maps to the Aqua version 6.2.0\n* 6.5: This is the latest and greatest version of Aqua (default)\n\n## Deploying the Aqua Operator\n\nAqua Operator follows an easy push button deployment that installs the operator in its own aqua namespace.\nPlease refer to the instructions [here](https://github.com/aquasecurity/aqua-operator/blob/6.2.0/docs/DeployOpenShiftOperator.md).\n\n## Configuring the Aqua Operator\n\nOperators leverage CRDs as a configuration mechanism for the application. Aqua offers a number of CRDs that can be tweaked and configured as per your needs. Please refer to this [link](https://github.com/aquasecurity/aqua-operator/blob/6.2.0/docs/DeployOpenShiftOperator.md#aquacsp-crds) for Custom Resource examples for popular scenarios.\n\n## Support\n\nFor support please contact support@aquasec.com.",

Make sure you have a license and to obtain one, please contact Aqua Security at [Contact Us](mailto:cloudsales@aquasec.com).\n2. Create a new project for aqua\n\n    ```oc new-project aqua```\n\n3. Create the secret for Aqua Database password. If you are using an External Database, make sure you use those credentials.\nNOTE: This step is optional and you can specify the Database password when creating the CRs.\n\n    ```oc create secret generic aqua-database-password --from-literal=db-password=<password> -n aqua```\n\nPlease note that for the certified operator, the Docker registry secret is NOT needed. For the Red Hat certified operator, the Aqua application images are stored in the Red Hat Connect registry and will be automatically pulled by the Aqua operator.\n\n## Choosing the right channel\n\nChannels are a flexible publishing mechanism that offers you three different Aqua versions to deploy, at any point. These channels map to their respective Aqua versions, describing the maturity based on where they are in their lifecycle:\n* 4.6: This maps to the older version of Aqua 4.6.0\n* 5.0: This maps to the Aqua version 5.0.0\n* 5.3: This maps to the Aqua version 5.3.0\n* 6.0: This maps to the Aqua version 6.0.0\n* 6.2: This maps to the Aqua version 6.2.0\n* 6.5: This is the latest and greatest version of Aqua (default)\n\n## Deploying the Aqua Operator\n\nAqua Operator follows an easy push button deployment that installs the operator in its own aqua namespace.\nPlease refer to the instructions [here](https://github.com/aquasecurity/aqua-operator/blob/6.2.0/docs/DeployOpenShiftOperator.md).\n\n## Configuring the Aqua Operator\n\nOperators leverage CRDs as a configuration mechanism for the application. Aqua offers a number of CRDs that can be tweaked and configured as per your needs. Please refer to this [link](https://github.com/aquasecurity/aqua-operator/blob/6.2.0/docs/DeployOpenShiftOperator.md#aquacsp-crds) for Custom Resource examples for popular scenarios.\n\n## Support\n\nFor support please contact support@aquasec.com.",

It eliminates the need for network storage and enables seamless interoperability between computing and storage in virtual environments. The Cisco HX Data Platform provides a highly fault-tolerant distributed storage system that preserves data integrity and optimizes performance for virtual machine (VM) storage workloads. In addition, native compression and deduplication reduce storage space occupied by the VMs and VM workloads.\n### HyperFlex CSI Driver\nThe Cisco HyperFlex Kubernetes CSI Integration allows Cisco HyperFlex to dynamically provide persistent storage to stateful Kubernetes workloads running on Cisco HyperFlex. The integration enables orchestration of the entire Persistent Volume object lifecycle to be offloaded and managed by Cisco HyperFlex, while being driven (initiated) by developers and users through standard Kubernetes Persistent Volume Claim objects. Developers and users get the benefit of leveraging Cisco HyperFlex for their Kubernetes persistent storage needs with zero additional administration overhead from their perspective.\n### Features Support\n- Support for CSI Spec 1.2 APIs\n- Kubernetes 1.18, 1.19, 1.20, 1.21 support\n- Kubernetes Cluster multi tenancy target masking using dedicated initiator group\n- Dynamic creation and deletion of volumes\n- Dynamic volume attach and detach\n- Block access support\n- CHAP support for iSCSI sessions\n- Clone volume (when source volume is from the same Datastore)\n- PV support with different filesystems (Ext4, Ext3, XFS)\n- Volume space statistics reporting per CSI specs\n- Multi-writer support (ReadWriteMany) for Block Mode only\n- Volume resize support for block mode volumes and ext3, ext4 filesystem volumes (expansion)\n",
