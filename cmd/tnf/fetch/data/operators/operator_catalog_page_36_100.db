Kong Operator is a Kubernetes operator which manages [Kong](https://konghq.com/kong/) and [Kong Enterprise](https://konghq.com/products/kong-enterprise/) clusters.\n\nKong Operator can deploy Kong in various configurations, for example:\n* as a [Kubernetes ingress controller](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller), enabling you to expose Kubernetes `Service`s via Kong,\n* a standalone Kong gateway (without the ingress controller; either DB-enabled or DB-less)\n* a standalone Ingress Controller (configuring an external instance of Kong)\n\nThose configurations are further described in the [_Deployment Options_](https://github.com/Kong/kong-operator/blob/v0.10.1/helm-charts/kong/README.md#deployment-options) section of documentation.\n\n### Quick Start\n\nThe [Quick Start guide](https://github.com/Kong/kong-operator/blob/v0.10.1/README.md#quick-start) uses Kong Operator to deploy\nour recommended Kong setup for Kubernetes users (Kong DB-less with Ingress Controller), which includes an instance of Kong\nserving as a proxy to an example Kubernetes service.\n\n### Documentation\n\nThe primary documentation site for Kong Operator is located [in its GitHub repository](https://github.com/Kong/kong-operator/blob/v0.10.1/README.md).\n\nKong Operator provides the same configuration flexibility as the Kong Helm chart.\nRefer to the [Helm chart documentation](https://github.com/Kong/kong-operator/blob/v0.10.1/helm-charts/kong/README.md),\nthe [Configuration](https://github.com/Kong/kong-operator/blob/v0.10.1/README.md#configuration) section of Kong Operator docs, and the example `Kong` resource below.\n\n### Upgrading from versions 0.8.0 and earlier\n\n0.10.0 changes the operator CRD to comply with Kubernetes requirements. Upgrades require manual work to move configuration into the new CRs.\nSee the [0.10.0 upgrade guide](https://github.com/Kong/kong-operator/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md#upgrading-from-previous-versions)\nfor steps to upgrade past 0.8.0.\n",

Kong Operator is a Kubernetes operator which manages [Kong](https://konghq.com/kong/) and [Kong Enterprise](https://konghq.com/products/kong-enterprise/) clusters.\n\nKong Operator can deploy Kong in various configurations, for example:\n* as a [Kubernetes ingress controller](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller), enabling you to expose Kubernetes `Service`s via Kong,\n* a standalone Kong gateway (without the ingress controller; either DB-enabled or DB-less)\n* a standalone Ingress Controller (configuring an external instance of Kong)\n\nThose configurations are further described in the [_Deployment Options_](https://github.com/Kong/kong-operator/blob/v0.10.1/helm-charts/kong/README.md#deployment-options) section of documentation.\n\n### Quick Start\n\nThe [Quick Start guide](https://github.com/Kong/kong-operator/blob/v0.10.1/README.md#quick-start) uses Kong Operator to deploy\nour recommended Kong setup for Kubernetes users (Kong DB-less with Ingress Controller), which includes an instance of Kong\nserving as a proxy to an example Kubernetes service.\n\n### Documentation\n\nThe primary documentation site for Kong Operator is located [in its GitHub repository](https://github.com/Kong/kong-operator/blob/v0.10.1/README.md).\n\nKong Operator provides the same configuration flexibility as the Kong Helm chart.\nRefer to the [Helm chart documentation](https://github.com/Kong/kong-operator/blob/v0.10.1/helm-charts/kong/README.md),\nthe [Configuration](https://github.com/Kong/kong-operator/blob/v0.10.1/README.md#configuration) section of Kong Operator docs, and the example `Kong` resource below.\n\n### Upgrading from versions 0.8.0 and earlier\n\n0.10.0 changes the operator CRD to comply with Kubernetes requirements. Upgrades require manual work to move configuration into the new CRs.\nSee the [0.10.0 upgrade guide](https://github.com/Kong/kong-operator/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md#upgrading-from-previous-versions)\nfor steps to upgrade past 0.8.0.\n",

      "csv_description": "\n## Percona is Cloud Native\n\nPercona Operator for MySQL based on Percona XtraDB Cluster is an open-source drop in replacement for MySQL Enterprise with synchronous replication running on Kubernetes. It automates the deployment and management of the members in your Percona XtraDB Cluster environment. It can be used to instantiate a new Percona XtraDB Cluster, or to scale an existing environment.\n\nConsult the [documentation](https://percona.github.io/percona-xtradb-cluster-operator/) on the Percona Operator for MySQL based on Percona XtraDB Cluster for complete details on capabilities and options.\n\n### Supported Features\n\n* **Scale Your Cluster**  change the `size` parameter to [add or remove members](https://percona.github.io/percona-xtradb-cluster-operator/install/scaling) of the cluster. Three is the minimum recommended size for a functioning cluster.\n\n* **Manage Your Users**  [add, remove, or change](https://percona.github.io/percona-xtradb-cluster-operator/configure/users) the privileges of database users\n\n* **Automate Your Backups**  [configure cluster backups](https://percona.github.io/percona-xtradb-cluster-operator/configure/operator) to run on a scheduled basis. Backups can be stored on a persistent volume or S3-compatible storage. Leverage [Point-in-time recovery](https://www.percona.com/doc/kubernetes-operator-for-pxc/backups.html#storing-binary-logs-for-point-in-time-recovery) to reduce RPO/RTO.\n* **Proxy integration**  choose HAProxy or ProxySQL as a proxy in front of the Percona XtraDB Cluster. Proxies are deployed and configured automatically with the Operator.\n\n### Common Configurations\n\n* **Set Resource Limits** - set limitation on requests to CPU and memory resources.\n\n* **Customize Storage** - set the desired Storage Class and Access Mode for your database cluster data.\n\n* **Control Scheduling** - define how your PXC Pods are scheduled onto the K8S cluster with tolerations, pod disruption budgets, node selector and affinity settings.\n* Automatic synchronization of MySQL users with ProxySQL\n* HAProxy Support\n* Fully automated minor version updates (Smart Update)\n* Update Reader members before Writer member at cluster upgrades\n* Support MySQL versions 5.7 and 8.0\n### Before You Start\n\nAdd the PXC user `Secret` to Kubernetes. User information must be placed in the data section of the `secrets.yaml`\nfile with Base64-encoded logins and passwords for the user accounts.\n\nBelow is a sample `secrets.yaml` file for the correct formatting.\n\n```\napiVersion: v1\nkind: Secret\nmetadata:\n  name: my-cluster-secrets\ntype: Opaque\ndata:\n  root: cm9vdF9wYXNzd29yZA==\n  xtrabackup: YmFja3VwX3Bhc3N3b3Jk\n  monitor: bW9uaXRvcg==\n  clustercheck: Y2x1c3RlcmNoZWNrcGFzc3dvcmQ=\n  proxyadmin: YWRtaW5fcGFzc3dvcmQ=\n  pmmserver: c3VwYXxefHBheno=\n  operator: b3BlcmF0b3JhZG1pbg==\n  replication: cmVwbF9wYXNzd29yZAo=\n\n```\n###  Release Highlights\n* With this release, the Operator turns to a simplified naming convention and changes its official name to Percona Operator for MySQL based on Percona XtraDB Cluster * The new backup.backoffLimit Custom Resource option allows customizing the number of attempts the Operator should make for backup * The OpenAPI schema is now generated for the Operator CRD, which allows Kubernetes to validate Custom Resource and protects users from occasionally applying deploy/cr.yaml with syntax errors\n\n",

      "csv_description": "\n## Percona is Cloud Native\n\nPercona Operator for MySQL based on Percona XtraDB Cluster is an open-source drop in replacement for MySQL Enterprise with synchronous replication running on Kubernetes. It automates the deployment and management of the members in your Percona XtraDB Cluster environment. It can be used to instantiate a new Percona XtraDB Cluster, or to scale an existing environment.\n\nConsult the [documentation](https://percona.github.io/percona-xtradb-cluster-operator/) on the Percona Operator for MySQL based on Percona XtraDB Cluster for complete details on capabilities and options.\n\n### Supported Features\n\n* **Scale Your Cluster**  change the `size` parameter to [add or remove members](https://percona.github.io/percona-xtradb-cluster-operator/install/scaling) of the cluster. Three is the minimum recommended size for a functioning cluster.\n\n* **Manage Your Users**  [add, remove, or change](https://percona.github.io/percona-xtradb-cluster-operator/configure/users) the privileges of database users\n\n* **Automate Your Backups**  [configure cluster backups](https://percona.github.io/percona-xtradb-cluster-operator/configure/operator) to run on a scheduled basis. Backups can be stored on a persistent volume or S3-compatible storage. Leverage [Point-in-time recovery](https://www.percona.com/doc/kubernetes-operator-for-pxc/backups.html#storing-binary-logs-for-point-in-time-recovery) to reduce RPO/RTO.\n* **Proxy integration**  choose HAProxy or ProxySQL as a proxy in front of the Percona XtraDB Cluster. Proxies are deployed and configured automatically with the Operator.\n\n### Common Configurations\n\n* **Set Resource Limits** - set limitation on requests to CPU and memory resources.\n\n* **Customize Storage** - set the desired Storage Class and Access Mode for your database cluster data.\n\n* **Control Scheduling** - define how your PXC Pods are scheduled onto the K8S cluster with tolerations, pod disruption budgets, node selector and affinity settings.\n* Automatic synchronization of MySQL users with ProxySQL\n* HAProxy Support\n* Fully automated minor version updates (Smart Update)\n* Update Reader members before Writer member at cluster upgrades\n* Support MySQL versions 5.7 and 8.0\n### Before You Start\n\nAdd the PXC user `Secret` to Kubernetes. User information must be placed in the data section of the `secrets.yaml`\nfile with Base64-encoded logins and passwords for the user accounts.\n\nBelow is a sample `secrets.yaml` file for the correct formatting.\n\n```\napiVersion: v1\nkind: Secret\nmetadata:\n  name: my-cluster-secrets\ntype: Opaque\ndata:\n  root: cm9vdF9wYXNzd29yZA==\n  xtrabackup: YmFja3VwX3Bhc3N3b3Jk\n  monitor: bW9uaXRvcg==\n  clustercheck: Y2x1c3RlcmNoZWNrcGFzc3dvcmQ=\n  proxyadmin: YWRtaW5fcGFzc3dvcmQ=\n  pmmserver: c3VwYXxefHBheno=\n  operator: b3BlcmF0b3JhZG1pbg==\n  replication: cmVwbF9wYXNzd29yZAo=\n\n```\n###  Release Highlights\n* With this release, the Operator turns to a simplified naming convention and changes its official name to Percona Operator for MySQL based on Percona XtraDB Cluster * The new backup.backoffLimit Custom Resource option allows customizing the number of attempts the Operator should make for backup * The OpenAPI schema is now generated for the Operator CRD, which allows Kubernetes to validate Custom Resource and protects users from occasionally applying deploy/cr.yaml with syntax errors\n\n",

      "csv_description": "\n## Percona is Cloud Native\n\nPercona Operator for MySQL based on Percona XtraDB Cluster is an open-source drop in replacement for MySQL Enterprise with synchronous replication running on Kubernetes. It automates the deployment and management of the members in your Percona XtraDB Cluster environment. It can be used to instantiate a new Percona XtraDB Cluster, or to scale an existing environment.\n\nConsult the [documentation](https://percona.github.io/percona-xtradb-cluster-operator/) on the Percona Operator for MySQL based on Percona XtraDB Cluster for complete details on capabilities and options.\n\n### Supported Features\n\n* **Scale Your Cluster**  change the `size` parameter to [add or remove members](https://percona.github.io/percona-xtradb-cluster-operator/install/scaling) of the cluster. Three is the minimum recommended size for a functioning cluster.\n\n* **Manage Your Users**  [add, remove, or change](https://percona.github.io/percona-xtradb-cluster-operator/configure/users) the privileges of database users\n\n* **Automate Your Backups**  [configure cluster backups](https://percona.github.io/percona-xtradb-cluster-operator/configure/operator) to run on a scheduled basis. Backups can be stored on a persistent volume or S3-compatible storage. Leverage [Point-in-time recovery](https://www.percona.com/doc/kubernetes-operator-for-pxc/backups.html#storing-binary-logs-for-point-in-time-recovery) to reduce RPO/RTO.\n* **Proxy integration**  choose HAProxy or ProxySQL as a proxy in front of the Percona XtraDB Cluster. Proxies are deployed and configured automatically with the Operator.\n\n### Common Configurations\n\n* **Set Resource Limits** - set limitation on requests to CPU and memory resources.\n\n* **Customize Storage** - set the desired Storage Class and Access Mode for your database cluster data.\n\n* **Control Scheduling** - define how your PXC Pods are scheduled onto the K8S cluster with tolerations, pod disruption budgets, node selector and affinity settings.\n* Automatic synchronization of MySQL users with ProxySQL\n* HAProxy Support\n* Fully automated minor version updates (Smart Update)\n* Update Reader members before Writer member at cluster upgrades\n* Support MySQL versions 5.7 and 8.0\n### Before You Start\n\nAdd the PXC user `Secret` to Kubernetes. User information must be placed in the data section of the `secrets.yaml`\nfile with Base64-encoded logins and passwords for the user accounts.\n\nBelow is a sample `secrets.yaml` file for the correct formatting.\n\n```\napiVersion: v1\nkind: Secret\nmetadata:\n  name: my-cluster-secrets\ntype: Opaque\ndata:\n  root: cm9vdF9wYXNzd29yZA==\n  xtrabackup: YmFja3VwX3Bhc3N3b3Jk\n  monitor: bW9uaXRvcg==\n  clustercheck: Y2x1c3RlcmNoZWNrcGFzc3dvcmQ=\n  proxyadmin: YWRtaW5fcGFzc3dvcmQ=\n  pmmserver: c3VwYXxefHBheno=\n  operator: b3BlcmF0b3JhZG1pbg==\n  replication: cmVwbF9wYXNzd29yZAo=\n\n```\n###  Release Highlights\n* With this release, the Operator turns to a simplified naming convention and changes its official name to Percona Operator for MySQL based on Percona XtraDB Cluster * The new backup.backoffLimit Custom Resource option allows customizing the number of attempts the Operator should make for backup * The OpenAPI schema is now generated for the Operator CRD, which allows Kubernetes to validate Custom Resource and protects users from occasionally applying deploy/cr.yaml with syntax errors\n\n",

      "csv_description": "\n## Percona is Cloud Native\n\nPercona Operator for MySQL based on Percona XtraDB Cluster is an open-source drop in replacement for MySQL Enterprise with synchronous replication running on Kubernetes. It automates the deployment and management of the members in your Percona XtraDB Cluster environment. It can be used to instantiate a new Percona XtraDB Cluster, or to scale an existing environment.\n\nConsult the [documentation](https://percona.github.io/percona-xtradb-cluster-operator/) on the Percona Operator for MySQL based on Percona XtraDB Cluster for complete details on capabilities and options.\n\n### Supported Features\n\n* **Scale Your Cluster**  change the `size` parameter to [add or remove members](https://percona.github.io/percona-xtradb-cluster-operator/install/scaling) of the cluster. Three is the minimum recommended size for a functioning cluster.\n\n* **Manage Your Users**  [add, remove, or change](https://percona.github.io/percona-xtradb-cluster-operator/configure/users) the privileges of database users\n\n* **Automate Your Backups**  [configure cluster backups](https://percona.github.io/percona-xtradb-cluster-operator/configure/operator) to run on a scheduled basis. Backups can be stored on a persistent volume or S3-compatible storage. Leverage [Point-in-time recovery](https://www.percona.com/doc/kubernetes-operator-for-pxc/backups.html#storing-binary-logs-for-point-in-time-recovery) to reduce RPO/RTO.\n* **Proxy integration**  choose HAProxy or ProxySQL as a proxy in front of the Percona XtraDB Cluster. Proxies are deployed and configured automatically with the Operator.\n\n### Common Configurations\n\n* **Set Resource Limits** - set limitation on requests to CPU and memory resources.\n\n* **Customize Storage** - set the desired Storage Class and Access Mode for your database cluster data.\n\n* **Control Scheduling** - define how your PXC Pods are scheduled onto the K8S cluster with tolerations, pod disruption budgets, node selector and affinity settings.\n* Automatic synchronization of MySQL users with ProxySQL\n* HAProxy Support\n* Fully automated minor version updates (Smart Update)\n* Update Reader members before Writer member at cluster upgrades\n* Support MySQL versions 5.7 and 8.0\n### Before You Start\n\nAdd the PXC user `Secret` to Kubernetes. User information must be placed in the data section of the `secrets.yaml`\nfile with Base64-encoded logins and passwords for the user accounts.\n\nBelow is a sample `secrets.yaml` file for the correct formatting.\n\n```\napiVersion: v1\nkind: Secret\nmetadata:\n  name: my-cluster-secrets\ntype: Opaque\ndata:\n  root: cm9vdF9wYXNzd29yZA==\n  xtrabackup: YmFja3VwX3Bhc3N3b3Jk\n  monitor: bW9uaXRvcg==\n  clustercheck: Y2x1c3RlcmNoZWNrcGFzc3dvcmQ=\n  proxyadmin: YWRtaW5fcGFzc3dvcmQ=\n  pmmserver: c3VwYXxefHBheno=\n  operator: b3BlcmF0b3JhZG1pbg==\n  replication: cmVwbF9wYXNzd29yZAo=\n\n```\n###  Release Highlights\n* With this release, the Operator turns to a simplified naming convention and changes its official name to Percona Operator for MySQL based on Percona XtraDB Cluster * The new backup.backoffLimit Custom Resource option allows customizing the number of attempts the Operator should make for backup * The OpenAPI schema is now generated for the Operator CRD, which allows Kubernetes to validate Custom Resource and protects users from occasionally applying deploy/cr.yaml with syntax errors\n\n",
