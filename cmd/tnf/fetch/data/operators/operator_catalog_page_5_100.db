      "csv_description": "This advanced Operator is capable of deploying any runtime component image with consistent, production-grade QoS. It enables enterprise architects to govern the way their applications get deployed & managed in the cluster, while dramatically reducing the learning curve for developers to deploy into Kubernetes - allowing them to focus on writing the code!\nHere are some key features:\n#### Application Lifecyle\nYou can deploy your runtime component container by either pointing to a container image, or an OpenShift ImageStream. When using an ImageStream the Operator will watch for any updates and will re-deploy the modified image.\n\n#### Custom RBAC\nThis Operator is capable of using a custom ServiceAccount from the caller, allowing it to follow RBAC restrictions. By default it creates a ServiceAccount if one is not specified, which can also be bound with specific roles.\n\n#### Environment Configuration\nYou can configured a variety of artifacts with your deployment, such as: labels, annotations, and environment variables from a ConfigMap, a Secret or a value.\n\n#### Routing\nExpose your application to external users via a single toggle to create a Route on OpenShift or an Ingress on other Kubernetes environments. Advanced configuration, such as TLS settings, are also easily enabled.  Expiring Route certificates are re-issued.\n\n#### High Availability via Horizontal Pod Autoscaling\nRun multiple instances of your application for high availability. Either specify a static number of replicas or easily configure horizontal auto scaling to create (and delete) instances based on resource consumption.\n\n#### Persistence and advanced storage\nEnable persistence for your application by specifying simple requirements: just tell us the size of the storage and where you would like it to be mounted and We will create and manage that storage for you.\nThis toggles a StatefulSet resource instead of a Deployment resource, so your container can recover transactions and state upon a pod restart.\nWe offer an advanced mode where the user specifies a built-in PersistentVolumeClaim, allowing them to configure many details of the persistent volume, such as its storage class and access mode.\n\n#### Service Binding\nEasily bind to available services in your cluster.  Your runtime components can expose and consume other services by simply specifying the target endpoinds: we take care of the heavy lifting such as creating k8s Secrets, injecting them into your container and watching for any changes in configuration!  This way your applications can dynamically reconnect to its required services without any intervention or interruption.\n#### Exposing metrics to Prometheus\nThe Runtime Component Operator exposes the runtime container's metrics via the [Prometheus Operator](https://operatorhub.io/operator/prometheus).\nUsers can pick between a basic mode, where they simply specify the label that Prometheus is watching to scrape the metrics from the container, or they can specify the full `ServiceMonitor` spec embedded into the RuntimeComponent's `spec.monitoring` key controlling things like the poll internal and security credentials.\n#### Easily mount logs and transaction directories\nIf you need to mount the logs and transaction data from your runtime component to an external volume such as NFS (or any storage supported in your cluster), simply add the following (customizing the folder location and size) to your RuntimeComponent CR:\n``` storage: size: 2Gi mountPath: \"/logs\" ```\n\n#### Integration with OpenShift's Certificate Manager\nThe Runtime Component Operator takes advantage of the [cert-manager tool](https://cert-manager.io/), if it is installed on the cluster. This allows the operator to automatically provision TLS certificates for pods as well as routes.\nWhen creating certificates via the RuntimeComponent CR the user can specify a particular issuer name and toggle the scopes between ClusterIssuer (cluster scoped) and Issuer (namespace scoped). If not specified, these values are retrieved from a ConfigMap, with a default value of `self-signed` and `ClusterIssuer`.\nThe certificate is mounted into the container via a Secret so that it is automatically refreshed once the certificate is updated.\n#### Integration with OpenShift Serverless\nDeploy your serverless runtime component using a single toggle.  The Operator will convert all of its generated resources into [Knative](https://knative.dev) resources, allowing your pod to automatically scale to 0 when it is idle.\n\n#### Integration with Kubernetes Application Navigator (kAppNav) and OpenShift's Topology UI\nAutomatically configures the Kubernetes resources for integration with [kAppNav](https://kappnav.io/), allowing your runtime component to compose an umbrella [Application](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/application).  This integration allows users to monitor all constituents resources of the application and receive alerts when the health status of a component changes.  From an integrated panel users can also launch day-2-operations, such as viewing the Kibana / Grafana dashboards, and enabling trace for a component.\nDuring this integration we also set the corresponding labels to support OpenShift's Developer Topology UI,which allows you to visualize your entire set of deployments and how they are connected.\n\nSee our [**documentation**](https://github.com/application-stacks/runtime-component-operator/tree/master/doc/) for more information.\n",

Synopsys Operator assists in the deployment and management of Synopsys software like Black Duck, OpsSight Connector, and Black Duck Alert, in a Kubernetes and Red Hat OpenShift environment.\n\nThe Synopsys Operator deployment can be managed by a utility called [synopsysctl](https://github.com/blackducksoftware/synopsys-operator/releases). synopsysctl makes it easy to deploy Synopsys Operator, and it eliminates the need to edit YML/JSON configuration files when deploying and managing software with Synopsys Operator. Synopsysctl provides a rich set of command-line parameters to allow for fast and highly-configurable deployments of Black Duck, OpsSight Connector, and Black Duck Alert. synopsysctl\u2019s interface mimics that of kubectl and oc, making it immediately familiar to anyone with Kubernetes and/or Red Hat OpenShift experience.\n\n## Black Duck\n[Black Duck](https://www.synopsys.com/software-integrity/security-testing/software-composition-analysis.html) is a comprehensive solution for managing security, license compliance, and code quality risks that come from the use of open source in applications and containers. Black Duck gives you unmatched visibility into third-party code, enabling you to control it across your software supply chain and throughout the application life cycle.\n\n### Supported Features\n\n* **Find and fix security vulnerabilities** at each stage in the SDLC, with detailed, vulnerability-specific remediation guidance and technical insight.\n\n* **Eliminate risk of open source license** noncompliance and safeguard your intellectual property by using the industry\u2019s largest open source knowledge base to identify which of 2,500+ licenses are relevant to the open source in your applications.\n\n* **Scan virtually any software, firmware, and source code** to generate acomprehensive bill of materials (BoM) of what\u2019s inside.\n\n* **Automatically monitor for new vulnerabilities** hat affect your BoM, with custom policies and workflow triggers to accelerate remediation and reduce your risk exposure.\n\n## OpsSight Connector\n[Synopsys Black Duck OpsSight](https://synopsys.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/BDLM/pages/34242566/OpsSight) for Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform provides automated open source identification and monitoring in all container images in a Kubernetes or OpenShift cluster to give teams visibility into, and control over, the risks associated with open source components in those images.\n\n### Supported Features\n\n* **Automated Detection** - OpsSight\u2019s automated multifactor open source detection inventories all the open source in container images as they are deployed.\n\n* **Security Intelligence** -  Black Duck Enhanced Vulnerability Data identifies all known vulnerabilities for the open source in your container images while actionable mitigation and remediation guidance helps minimize exploit risk.\n\n* **Policy Management** - OpsSight policy management allows teams to define open source use and security policies, which are evaluated with each scan and documented as metadata on your containers, allowing you to flag images that violate policies and prevent them from deploying to production.\n\n* **Continous Monitoring** - OpsSight continuously monitors for newly reported open source security vulnerabilities associated with open source in use, providing same-day alerts so teams can understand how newly discovered vulnerabilities affect their containers in production.\n\n## Black Duck Alert\nBlack Duck Alert is an additional deployment to Black Duck that enables you to see Security Vulnerability and Policy Management notifications through email, Slack or HipChat.\n\n## About Synopsys\n\n[Synopsys Software Integrity](https://www.synopsys.com/software-integrity.html) helps development teams build secure, high-quality software, minimizing risks while maximizing speed and productivity. Synopsys, a recognized leader in application security, provides static analysis, software composition analysis, and dynamic analysis solutions that enable teams to quickly find and fix vulnerabilities and defects in proprietary code, open source components, and application behavior.",

After you install a proxy in your environment, it can handle thousands of simultaneous clients. Your data collection agents or custom code send data to the proxy, which consolidates points into configurable batches and sends the data to the Wavefront service.\n\n* **Wavefront Collector:-** With zero-configuration installation, the Wavefront Collector for Kubernetes auto-discovers and enables monitoring of Kubernetes, infrastructure, and Kubernetes workloads by sending full-stack - Kubernetes clusters, worker nodes, system, Kubernetes and Docker KPI, RED/USE of each layer and custom applications metrics to Wavefront.\n\n### Prerequisite\n\n* A Wavefront API token is needed to configure Wavefront Proxy.  Refer [Generating an API Token] (https://docs.wavefront.com/users_account_managing.html#generating-an-api-token) for generating a token.\n\n### Installing Wavefront Operator using default values\n\n* Create project with name *wavefront* in Openshift and install Wavefront Operator into it.  \n* Create Wavefront Proxy by providing Wavefront API token and URL in the Wavefront Proxy definition. \n* Create Wavefront Collector.\n\n### Advanced Options\n\nRefer Wavefront Operator [docs] (https://github.com/wavefrontHQ/wavefront-operator/blob/master/docs/openshift-operator.md) for configuring Wavefront Proxy and Wavefront Collector using advanced configuration parameters.\n",

By installing this integration you will be able to deploy Zabbix server / proxies and other components with a single command.\n## Supported Features\n* **Zabbix Server** - Simple Zabbix installation with included Zabbix server, Zabbix web-interface and Zabbix Java Gateway with MySQL database support. The feature does not provide MySQL service and requires an external MySQL database. \n* **Zabbix Server (Full)** - Zabbix installation with included Zabbix server, Zabbix web-interface, Zabbix Java Gateway and MySQL server instance.\n* **Zabbix proxy (SQLite3)** - Very simple way to gain power of Zabbix proxy. The feature has  SQLite3 support for Zabbix proxies and allow to specify amount of proxies. \n* **Zabbix proxy (MySQL)** - Another option of Zabbix proxy. The option support and deliver MySQL database.\n* **Zabbix agent** - Zabbix agent can be deployed on each available node for stability and performance monitoring on remote nodes. It allows to gather metrics with full automation!\n* **Zabbix Appliance** - Zabbix appliance very simple way to test and check Zabbix features. The option provides all core components in one solution. It includes Zabbix server, Zabbix Java Gateway, Zabbix web-interface and MySQL server in deployment. It is very useful for testing Zabbix features!\n## Prerequisites\nAll deployment options are require additional information during deployment. Please, check the following instructions and provide required configuration:\n* **Zabbix Server** - MySQL database host information and MySQL database credentials in specially formatted *Secret*. Additionally it is possible to specify SSL certificates for HTTPS support in *Secret*.\n* **Zabbix Server (Full)** - MySQL database credentials in specially formatted *Secret*. MySQL database volume name information. Additionally it is possible to specify SSL certificates for HTTPS support in *Secret*.\n* **Zabbix proxy (SQLite3)** - Zabbix server host information only.\n* **Zabbix proxy (MySQL)** - MySQL database credentials in specially formatted *Secrets* and Zabbix server host information.\n* **Zabbix agent** - Zabbix server host information only for outgoing and incoming connections. Zabbix agent uses \"privileged\" mode to monitor node resources! For example, running processes.\n* **Zabbix Appliance** - MySQL database credentials in specially formatted *Secret*. MySQL database volume name information. Additionally it is possible to specify SSL certificates for HTTPS support in *Secret*.\n### MySQL credentials\n```\nkind: Secret\napiVersion: v1\nmetadata:\n  name: zabbix-full-secrets\ndata:\n  mysql_root_password: emFiYml4X3N1cGVyX3Jvb3Q= [1]\n  mysql_zabbix_password: emFiYml4X3VzZXJfcGFzc3dvcmQ= [2]\n  mysql_zabbix_username: emFiYml4 [3]\ntype: Opaque\n```\nUsing MySQL root password (*mysqlrootpassword* [1]) Zabbix server / proxy will try to create MySQL database schema with grant permissions to *mysqlzabbixusername* [2] and *mysqlzabbixpassword* [3].\n### SSL certificates for HTTPS\n```\nkind: Secret\napiVersion: v1\nmetadata:\n  name: zabbix-web-sslsecret\ndata:\n  ssl.crt: >-\n   < ssl.crt data>\n  ssl.key: >-\n\t < ssl.key data >\n  dhparam.pem: >-\n   <  dhparam.pem data >\n```\nFiles *ssl.crt*, *ssl.key* and *dhparam.perm* are required for Zabbix web-interface for SSL support.\n",

      "csv_description": "# Instana\n\nInstana is an [APM solution](https://www.instana.com/product-overview/) built for microservices that enables IT Ops to build applications faster and deliver higher quality services by automating monitoring, tracing and root cause analysis. The solution is optimized for [Kubernetes](https://www.instana.com/automatic-kubernetes-monitoring/) and [OpenShift](https://www.instana.com/blog/automatic-root-cause-analysis-for-openshift-applications/).\n\n## Instana Agent Operator\n\nThis is the Kubernetes Operator for installing the Instana Agent on Kubernetes or OpenShift.\n\n## Prerequisites for OpenShift\n\nBefore the agent will be able to run in OpenShift, you need to perform a couple of extra configuration steps.\n\nYou need to set up a project for the Instana Agent and configure it's permissions.\n\nThe project you create here needs to be the namespace where you create the Instana Agent custom resource that the operator will use to deploy the agent.\n\nFor example, create the `instana-agent` project:\n\n    oc new-project instana-agent\n\nThen, ensure the `instana-agent` service account is in the privileged security context:\n\n    oc adm policy add-scc-to-user privileged -z instana-agent\n\nThis service account will be created by the operator.\n\nNow you can proceed with installing the operator for the Instana agent.\n\n## Installation and Configuration\n\nFirst, install this operator from [OperatorHub.io](https://operatorhub.io/), [OpenShift Container Platform](https://www.openshift.com/), or [OKD](https://www.okd.io/).\n\nSecond, create the target namespace where the Instana agent should be installed. The agent does not need to run in the same namespace as the operator. Most users create a new namespace `instana-agent` for running the agents.\n\nThird, create a custom resource with the agent configuration in the target namespace. The operator will pick up the custom resource and install the Instana agent accordingly.\n\nThe following is a minimal template of the custom resource:\n\n```yaml\napiVersion: instana.io/v1beta1\nkind: InstanaAgent\nmetadata:\n  name: instana-agent\n  namespace: instana-agent\nspec:\n  agent.zone.name: my-zone # (optional) name of the zone of the host\n  agent.key: replace-me # replace with your Instana agent key\n  agent.endpoint.host: ingress-red-saas.instana.io # the monitoring ingress endpoint\n  agent.endpoint.port: 443 # the monitoring ingress endpoint port, wrapped in quotes\n  agent.env:\n    INSTANA_AGENT_TAGS: example\n  cluster.name: replace-me # replace with the name of your Kubernetes cluster\n  config.files:\n    configuration.yaml: |\n      # You can leave this empty, or use this to configure your instana agent.\n      # See https://docs.instana.io/setup_and_manage/host_agent/on/kubernetes/\n```\n\nSave the template in a file `instana-agent.yaml` and edit the following values:\n\n* If your target namespace is not `instana-agent`, replace the `namespace:` accordingly.\n* `agent.key` must be set with your Instana agent key.\n* `agent.endpoint` must be set with the monitoring ingress endpoint, generally either `saas-us-west-2.instana.io` or `saas-eu-west-1.instana.io`.\n* `agent.endpoint.port` must be set with the monitoring ingress port, generally \"443\" (wrapped in quotes).\n* `agent.zone.name` should be set with the name of the Kubernetes cluster that is be displayed in Instana.\n\nFor advanced configuration, you can edit the contents of the `configuration.yaml` file. View documentation [here](https://docs.instana.io/setup_and_manage/host_agent/on/kubernetes/).\n\nApply the custom resource with `kubectl apply -f instana-agent.yaml`. After some time, you should see `instana-agent` Pods being created on each node of your cluster, and your cluster should show on the infrastructure map on your Instana Web interface.\n\n## Uninstalling\n\nIn order to uninstall the Instana agent, simply remove the custom resource with `kubectl delete -f instana-agent.yaml`.\n\n## Source Code\n\nThe Instana agent operator is an open source project hosted on [https://github.com/instana/instana-agent-operator](https://github.com/instana/instana-agent-operator/).\n",

It allows the optimization of data plane performance to reduce total cost of ownership while maintaining a high degree of flexibility.  The Intel FPGA PAC N3000 plays a key role in accelerating 5G and network functions virtualization (NFV) adoption for ecosystem partners such as telecommunications equipment manufacturers (TEMs) virtual network functions (VNF) vendors, system integrators and telcos, to bring scalable and high-performance solutions to market. The Intel FPGA PAC N3000 includes a variant that is design to be Network Equipment Building System (NEBS)-friendly, and features a Root-of-Trust device that helps protect systems from FPGA host security exploits. This document explains how the FPGA resource can be used on the Open Network Edge Services Software (OpenNESS) platform for accelerating network functions and edge application workloads. We use the Intel\u00ae FPGA PAC N3000 as a reference FPGA PAC and use LTE/5G Forward Error Correction (FEC) as an example workload that accelerates the 5G or 4G L1 base station network function. The same concept and mechanism is applicable for application acceleration workloads like AI and ML on FPGA for Inference applications. The Intel\u00ae FPGA PAC N3000 is a full-duplex, 100 Gbps in-system, re-programmable acceleration card for multi-workload networking application acceleration. It has an optimal memory mixture designed for network functions, with an integrated network interface card (NIC) in a small form factor that enables high throughput, low latency, and low power per bit for a custom networking pipeline.",

The NeuVector operator contains all necessary information to deploy NeuVector using helm charts. You simply need to install the NeuVector operator from the OpenShift embeded operator hub and create NeuVector instance. You can modify the NeuVector installation configuration by modifying yaml while creating the NeuVector instance such as imagePullSecrets, tag version, etc. Please refer to [NeuVector Helm Chart](https://github.com/neuvector/neuvector-helm) for the values that can be modifed during installation. To upgrade to a newer version of NeuVector, just reapply the NeuVector instance with desired tag , which in turn pulls the specified NeuVector image tags and upgrades as per upgrade plan configured on the helm chart. \n\n**Complete below steps to create secret for accessing Docker or similar registry and Grant Service Account Access to the Privileged SCC before installation.**\n\nCreate the NeuVector namespace\n\n         oc new-project  neuvector\nConfigure OpenShift to pull images from the private NeuVector registry on Docker Hub\n\n         oc create secret docker-registry regsecret -n neuvector --docker-server=https://index.docker.io/v1/ --docker-username=your-name --docker-password=your-pword --docker-email=your-email\n\t\t\t\t \n\nWhere \u2019your-name\u2019 is your Docker username, \u2019your-pword\u2019 is your Docker password, \u2019your-email\u2019 is your Docker email.\n\nLogin as system:admin account\n\n         oc login -u system:admin\n\nGrant Service Account Access to the Privileged SCC\n\n         oc -n neuvector adm policy add-scc-to-user privileged -z default\n\nThe following info will be added in the Privileged SCC users:\n\n         - system:serviceaccount:neuvector:default\n\n\n#Deploying the NeuVector Operator#\n\n\nPlease refer to the instructions [here](https://github.com/neuvector/neuvector-operator/blob/master/README.md)\n\n\n",

Please skip these versions.\n\n## Overview\nOpenshift Operator to deploy JFrog Artifactory Enterprise into your Openshift cluster.\n## Security Context Constraints\nTo deploy this helm chart you will need to be a cluster admin w/ access to the anyuid scc and add the operator service account to the anyuid scc.\n```\noc adm policy add-scc-to-user anyuid -z artifactory-ha-operator -n openshift-operators\n```\nAdd the service account for the Artifactory chart to deploy successfully:\n``` oc adm policy add-scc-to-user anyuid -z openshiftartifactoryha-artifactory-ha -n artifactory ```\n## Usage\n\nAn external DB is required. The operator will not deploy a DB but will require you to specify the configuration values to connect to it.\n\nSearch for JFrog and click JFrog Artifactory Enterprise Operator to install.\n\nGo to the Installed Operators.\n\nWait for the JFrog Artifactory Enterprise Operator to complete the installation.\n\nOpen the Operator and click on the provided API: Artifactory HA.\n\nClick Create New Instance and provide the following parameters for your DB configuration:\n\n```\nDATABASE_TYPE\nDATABASE_DRIVER\nDATABASE_URL\nDATABASE_USER\nDATABASE_PASSWORD\n```\nMaster key and Join key must be supplied. To generate a new key for each run the command below:\n\n```\n# Create a key\nexport JOIN_KEY=$(openssl rand -hex 32)\necho ${JOIN_KEY}\n```\n\nTo use TLS you will need to first create a k8s tls secret to store your .crt and .key file into.\nThen supply the value of this k8s secret into the TLS_SECRET field.\n``` oc create secret tls my_tls_secret --cert=tls.crt --key=tls.key --namespace=my_namespace ```\nClick Create for Artifactory Enterprise to deploy into OpenShift and connect to it on the external IP exposed by the load balancer.\n# Create a route\nTo expose Artifactory from Openshift we recommend you create a new route in Openshift.\nYou can either use the oc command line tool or the Openshift web console to generate a new route.\nDepending upon where you terminate TLS you will need to either specify pass through or edge.\nCommand Line (Edge):\n``` oc create route edge --service=openshiftartifactory-ha --cert=tls.crt --key=tls.key --ca-cert=ca.crt --hostname=www.example.com ```\nOr for more information visit the official Openshift documentation on routes here:\nhttps://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.6/networking/routes/route-configuration.html\n\n",

The prerequisites below also mentioned and can be viewed via OpenShift.\n### Preparing worker nodes\nPerform these steps for each worker node in Kubernetes cluster:\n#### 1. Perform this step to ensure iSCSI connectivity, when using RHEL OS.\nIf using RHCOS or if the packages are already installed, continue to the next step.\nRHEL 7.x:\n```bash\nyum -y install iscsi-initiator-utils   # Only if iSCSI connectivity is required\nyum -y install xfsprogs                # Only if XFS file system is required\n```\n#### 2. Configure Linux\u00ae multipath devices on the host.\n**Important:** Be sure to configure each worker with storage connectivity according to your storage system instructions.\nFor more information, find your storage system documentation on [IBM Knowledge Center](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter).\n##### 2.1 Additional configuration steps for OpenShift\u00ae Container Platform users (RHEL and RHCOS). Other users can continue to step 3.\nThe following yaml file example is for both Fibre Channel and iSCSI configurations. To support iSCSI, uncomment the last two lines in the file:\n**Important:** The  `99-ibm-attach.yaml` configuration file overrides any files that already exist on your system. Only use this file if the files mentioned in the yaml below are not already created. If one or more have been created, edit this yaml file, as necessary.\nSave the `99-ibm-attach.yaml` file.\n```bash\napiVersion: machineconfiguration.openshift.io/v1\nkind: MachineConfig\nmetadata:\nlabels:\nmachineconfiguration.openshift.io/role: worker\nname: 99-ibm-attach\nspec:\nconfig:\nignition:\nversion: 2.2.0\nstorage:\nfiles:\n- path: /etc/multipath.conf\nmode: 384\nfilesystem: root\ncontents:\nsource: data:,defaults%20%7B%0A%20%20%20%20path_checker%20tur%0A%20%20%20%20path_selector\n%20%22round-robin%200%22%0A%20%20%20%20rr_weight%20uniform%0A%20%20%20%20prio%20const%0A\n%20%20%20%20rr_min_io_rq%201%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%0A%20%20%20%20polling_interval\n%2030%0A%20%20%20%20path_grouping_policy%20multibus%0A%20%20%20%20find_multipaths%20yes%0A\n%20%20%20%20no_path_retry%20fail%0A%20%20%20%20user_friendly_names%20yes%0A%20%20%20%20failback\n%20immediate%0A%20%20%20%20checker_timeout%2010%0A%20%20%20%20fast_io_fail_tmo%20off%0A%7D%0A%0Adevices\n%20%7B%0A%20%20%20%20device%20%7B%0A%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20path_checker%20tur%0A\n%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20product%20%22FlashSystem%22%0A%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20vendor%20%22IBM%22%0A\n%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20rr_weight%20uniform%0A%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20rr_min_io_rq\n%204%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%0A%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20path_grouping_policy\n%20multibus%0A%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20path_selector%20%22round-robin%200%22%0A\n%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20no_path_retry%20fail%0A%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20failback%20immediate%0A\n%20%20%20%20%7D%0A%20%20%20%20device%20%7B%0A%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20path_checker%20tur%0A\n%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20product%20%22FlashSystem-9840%22%0A%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20vendor%20%22IBM%22%0A\n%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20fast_io_fail_tmo%20off%0A%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20rr_weight%20uniform%0A\n%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20rr_min_io_rq%201000%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%0A\n%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20path_grouping_policy%20multibus%0A%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20path_selector\n%20%22round-robin%200%22%0A%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20no_path_retry%20fail%0A\n%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20failback%20immediate%0A%20%20%20%20%7D%0A%20%20%20%20device%20%7B%0A\n%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20vendor%20%22IBM%22%0A%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20product%20%222145%22%0A\n%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20path_checker%20tur%0A%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20features%20%221%20queue_if_no_path\n%22%0A%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20path_grouping_policy%20group_by_prio%0A\n%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20path_selector%20%22service-time%200%22%20%23%20Used%20by%20Red%20Hat%207.x%0A\n%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20prio%20alua%0A%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20rr_min_io_rq%201%0A\n%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20rr_weight%20uniform%20%0A%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20no_path_retry%20%225%22%0A\n%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20dev_loss_tmo%20120%0A%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20failback%20immediate%0A%20%20%20%7D\n%0A%7D%0A\nverification: {}\n- path: /etc/udev/rules.d/99-ibm-2145.rules\nmode: 420\nfilesystem: root\ncontents:\nsource: data:,%23%20Set%20SCSI%20command%20timeout%20to%20120s%20%28default%20%3D%3D\n%2030%20or%2060%29%20for%20IBM%202145%20devices%0ASUBSYSTEM%3D%3D%22block%22%2C%20ACTION%3D%3D%22add\n%22%2C%20ENV%7BID_VENDOR%7D%3D%3D%22IBM%22%2CENV%7BID_MODEL%7D%3D%3D%222145%22%2C%20RUN%2B%3D%22/bin/sh\n%20-c%20%27echo%20120%20%3E/sys/block/%25k/device/timeout%27%22%0A\nverification: {}\nsystemd:\nunits:\n- name: multipathd.service\nenabled: true\n# Uncomment the following lines if this MachineConfig will be used with iSCSI connectivity\n#- name: iscsid.service\n#    enabled: true\n```\nApply the yaml file.\n```bash\noc apply -f 99-ibm-attach.yaml\n```\n#### 3.

Configure storage system connectivity\n##### 4.1. Define the hostname of each Kubernetes node on the relevant storage systems with the valid WWPN(for Fibre Channel) or IQN(for iSCSI) of the node.\n##### 4.2. For Fibre Channel, configure the relevant zoning from the storage to the host.\n## Installation\n### Install the operator\n#### 1. Download the manifest from GitHub.\n```bash\ncurl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/IBM/ibm-block-csi-operator/master/deploy/installer/generated/ibm-block-csi-operator.yaml > ibm-block-csi-operator.yaml\n```\n#### 2. (Optional): If required, update the image fields in the ibm-block-csi-operator.yaml.\n#### 3. Create a namespace.\n```bash\n$ kubectl create ns <namespace>\n```\n#### 4. Install the operator, while using a user-defined namespace.\n```bash\n$ kubectl -n <namespace> apply -f ibm-block-csi-operator.yaml\n```\n### Verify the operator is running:\n```bash\n$ kubectl get pod -l app.kubernetes.io/name=ibm-block-csi-operator -n <namespace>\nNAME                                    READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE\nibm-block-csi-operator-5bb7996b86-xntss 1/1     Running   0          10m\n```\n### Create an IBMBlockCSI custom resource\n#### 1.

Create a storage system secret - to define the storage system credentials (user and password) and its address.\n 2. Configure the storage class - to define the storage system pool name, secret reference, `SpaceEfficiency`, and `fstype`.\n#### 1. Create an array secret\nCreate a secret file as follows `array-secret.yaml` and update the relevant credentials:\n```\nkind: Secret\napiVersion: v1\nmetadata:\n  name: <NAME>\n  namespace: <NAMESPACE>\ntype: Opaque\nstringData:\n  management_address: <ADDRESS-1, ADDRESS-2> # Array management addresses\n  username: <USERNAME>                   # Array username\ndata:\n  password: <PASSWORD base64>            # Array password\n```\nApply the secret:\n```\n$ kubectl apply -f array-secret.yaml\n```\nTo create the secret using a command line terminal, use the following command:\n```bash\nkubectl create secret generic <NAME> --from-literal=username=<USER> --fromliteral=password=<PASSWORD> --from-literal=management_address=<ARRAY_MGMT> -n <namespace>\n```\n#### 2. Create storage classes\nCreate a storage class `demo-storageclass-gold-pvc.yaml` file as follows, with the relevant capabilities, pool and, array secret.\nUse the `SpaceEfficiency` parameters for each storage system. These values are not case sensitive:\n* IBM FlashSystem A9000 and A9000R\n    * Always includes deduplication and compression.\n    No need to specify during configuration.\n* IBM Spectrum Virtualize Family\n    * `thick` (default value, if not specified)\n    * `thin`\n    * `compressed`\n    * `deduplicated`\n* IBM DS8000 Family\n    * `none` (default value, if not specified)\n    * `thin`\n```\nkind: StorageClass\napiVersion: storage.k8s.io/v1\nmetadata:\n  name: gold\nprovisioner: block.csi.ibm.com\nparameters:\n  SpaceEfficiency: <VALUE>          # Optional: Values applicable for Spectrum Virtualize Family are: thin, compressed, or deduplicated\n  pool: <POOL_NAME>\t                # DS8000 Family paramater is pool ID\n  csi.storage.k8s.io/provisioner-secret-name: <ARRAY_SECRET>\n  csi.storage.k8s.io/provisioner-secret-namespace: <ARRAY_SECRET_NAMESPACE>\n  csi.storage.k8s.io/controller-publish-secret-name: <ARRAY_SECRET>\n  csi.storage.k8s.io/controller-publish-secret-namespace: <ARRAY_SECRET_NAMESPACE>\n  csi.storage.k8s.io/controller-expand-secret-name: <ARRAY_SECRET>\n  csi.storage.k8s.io/controller-expand-secret-namespace: <ARRAY_SECRET_NAMESPACE>\n  csi.storage.k8s.io/fstype: xfs    # Optional: Values ext4/xfs. The default is ext4.\n  volume_name_prefix: <prefix_name> # Optional: DS8000 Family maximum prefix length is 5 characters. Maximum prefix length for other systems is 20 characters.\nallowVolumeExpansion: true\n```\n#### 3. Apply the storage class:\n```bash\n$ kubectl apply -f demo-storageclass-gold-pvc.yaml\nstorageclass.storage.k8s.io/gold created\n```\n",

The prerequisites below also mentioned and can be viewed via OpenShift.\n### Preparing worker nodes\nPerform these steps for each worker node in Kubernetes cluster:\n#### 1. Perform this step to ensure iSCSI connectivity, when using RHEL OS.\nIf using RHCOS or if the packages are already installed, continue to the next step.\nRHEL 7.x:\n```bash\nyum -y install iscsi-initiator-utils   # Only if iSCSI connectivity is required\nyum -y install xfsprogs                # Only if XFS file system is required\n```\n#### 2. Configure Linux\u00ae multipath devices on the host.\n**Important:** Be sure to configure each worker with storage connectivity according to your storage system instructions.\nFor more information, find your storage system documentation on [IBM Knowledge Center](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter).\n##### 2.1 Additional configuration steps for OpenShift\u00ae Container Platform users (RHEL and RHCOS). Other users can continue to step 3.\nThe following yaml file example is for both Fibre Channel and iSCSI configurations.

If needed, enable support for volume snapshots (FlashCopy\u00ae function) on your Kubernetes cluster.\nFor more information and instructions, see the Kubernetes blog post, [Kubernetes 1.17 Feature: Kubernetes Volume Snapshot Moves to Beta](https://kubernetes.io/blog/2019/12/09/kubernetes-1-17-feature-cis-volume-snapshot-beta/).\n#### 4. Configure storage system connectivity\n##### 4.1. Define the hostname of each Kubernetes node on the relevant storage systems with the valid WWPN(for Fibre Channel) or IQN(for iSCSI) of the node.\n##### 4.2. For Fibre Channel, configure the relevant zoning from the storage to the host.\n## Installation\n### Install the operator\n#### 1. Download the manifest from GitHub.\n```bash\ncurl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/IBM/ibm-block-csi-operator/master/deploy/installer/generated/ibm-block-csi-operator.yaml > ibm-block-csi-operator.yaml\n```\n#### 2. (Optional): If required, update the image fields in the ibm-block-csi-operator.yaml.\n#### 3. Create a namespace.\n```bash\n$ kubectl create ns <namespace>\n```\n#### 4. Install the operator, while using a user-defined namespace.\n```bash\n$ kubectl -n <namespace> apply -f ibm-block-csi-operator.yaml\n```\n### Verify the operator is running:\n```bash\n$ kubectl get pod -l app.kubernetes.io/name=ibm-block-csi-operator -n <namespace>\nNAME                                    READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE\nibm-block-csi-operator-5bb7996b86-xntss 1/1     Running   0          10m\n```\n### Create an IBMBlockCSI custom resource\n#### 1. Download the manifest from GitHub.\n```bash\ncurl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/IBM/ibm-block-csi-operator/master/deploy/crds/csi.ibm.com_v1_ibmblockcsi_cr.yaml > csi.ibm.com_v1_ibmblockcsi_cr.yaml\n```\n#### 2. (Optional): If required, update the image fields in the csi.ibm.com_v1_ibmblockcsi_cr.yaml.\n#### 3. Install the csi.ibm.com_v1_ibmblockcsi_cr.yaml.\n```bash\n$ kubectl -n <namespace> apply -f csi.ibm.com_v1_ibmblockcsi_cr.yaml\n```\n### Verify the driver is running:\n```bash\n$ kubectl get all -n <namespace>  -l csi\nNAME                             READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE\npod/ibm-block-csi-controller-0   6/6     Running   0          9m36s\npod/ibm-block-csi-node-jvmvh     3/3     Running   0          9m36s\npod/ibm-block-csi-node-tsppw     3/3     Running   0          9m36s\nNAME                                DESIRED   CURRENT   READY   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   NODE SELECTOR   AGE\ndaemonset.apps/ibm-block-csi-node   2         2         2       2            2           <none>          9m36s\nNAME                                        READY   AGE\nstatefulset.apps/ibm-block-csi-controller   1/1     9m36s\n```\n## Configuring k8s secret and storage class\nIn order to use the driver, create the relevant storage classes and secrets, as needed.\nThis section describes how to:\n 1. Create a storage system secret - to define the storage system credentials (user and password) and its address.\n 2. Configure the storage class - to define the storage system pool name, secret reference, `SpaceEfficiency`, and `fstype`.\n#### 1. Create an array secret\nCreate a secret file as follows `array-secret.yaml` and update the relevant credentials:\n```\nkind: Secret\napiVersion: v1\nmetadata:\n  name: <NAME>\n  namespace: <NAMESPACE>\ntype: Opaque\nstringData:\n  management_address: <ADDRESS-1, ADDRESS-2> # Array management addresses\n  username: <USERNAME>                   # Array username\ndata:\n  password: <PASSWORD base64>            # Array password\n```\nApply the secret:\n```\n$ kubectl apply -f array-secret.yaml\n```\nTo create the secret using a command line terminal, use the following command:\n```bash\nkubectl create secret generic <NAME> --from-literal=username=<USER> --fromliteral=password=<PASSWORD> --from-literal=management_address=<ARRAY_MGMT> -n <namespace>\n```\n#### 2. Create storage classes\nCreate a storage class `demo-storageclass-gold-pvc.yaml` file as follows, with the relevant capabilities, pool and, array secret.\nUse the `SpaceEfficiency` parameters for each storage system. These values are not case sensitive:\n* IBM FlashSystem A9000 and A9000R\n    * Always includes deduplication and compression.\n    No need to specify during configuration.\n* IBM Spectrum Virtualize Family\n    * `thick` (default value, if not specified)\n    * `thin`\n    * `compressed`\n    * `deduplicated`\n* IBM DS8000 Family\n    * `none` (default value, if not specified)\n    * `thin`\n```\nkind: StorageClass\napiVersion: storage.k8s.io/v1\nmetadata:\n  name: gold\nprovisioner: block.csi.ibm.com\nparameters:\n  SpaceEfficiency: <VALUE>          # Optional: Values applicable for Spectrum Virtualize Family are: thin, compressed, or deduplicated\n  pool: <POOL_NAME>\t                # DS8000 Family paramater is pool ID\n  csi.storage.k8s.io/provisioner-secret-name: <ARRAY_SECRET>\n  csi.storage.k8s.io/provisioner-secret-namespace: <ARRAY_SECRET_NAMESPACE>\n  csi.storage.k8s.io/controller-publish-secret-name: <ARRAY_SECRET>\n  csi.storage.k8s.io/controller-publish-secret-namespace: <ARRAY_SECRET_NAMESPACE>\n  csi.storage.k8s.io/controller-expand-secret-name: <ARRAY_SECRET>\n  csi.storage.k8s.io/controller-expand-secret-namespace: <ARRAY_SECRET_NAMESPACE>\n  csi.storage.k8s.io/fstype: xfs    # Optional: Values ext4/xfs. The default is ext4.\n  volume_name_prefix: <prefix_name> # Optional: DS8000 Family maximum prefix length is 5 characters. Maximum prefix length for other systems is 20 characters.\nallowVolumeExpansion: true\n```\n#### 3. Apply the storage class:\n```bash\n$ kubectl apply -f demo-storageclass-gold-pvc.yaml\nstorageclass.storage.k8s.io/gold created\n```\n",

These components include the NVIDIA drivers (to enable CUDA), Kubernetes device plugin for GPUs, the NVIDIA Container Runtime, automatic node labelling and NVIDIA DCGM exporter.\nVisit the official site of the [GPU Operator](https://github.com/NVIDIA/gpu-operator) for more information.

However, configuring and managing nodes with these hardware resources requires configuration of multiple software components such as drivers, container runtimes or other libraries which are difficult and prone to errors.\nThe NVIDIA GPU Operator uses the [operator framework](https://coreos.com/blog/introducing-operator-framework) within Kubernetes to automate the management of all NVIDIA software components needed to provision and monitor GPUs. These components include the NVIDIA drivers (to enable CUDA), Kubernetes device plugin for GPUs, the NVIDIA Container Runtime, automatic node labelling and NVIDIA DCGM exporter.\nVisit the official site of the [GPU Operator](https://github.com/NVIDIA/gpu-operator) for more information. For getting started with using the GPU Operator with OpenShift, see the instructions [here](https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/kubernetes/openshift-on-gpu-install-guide/index.html).\n",

The solution is optimized for [Kubernetes](https://www.instana.com/automatic-kubernetes-monitoring/) and [OpenShift](https://www.instana.com/blog/automatic-root-cause-analysis-for-openshift-applications/).\n\n## Instana Agent Operator\n\nThis is the Kubernetes Operator for installing the Instana Agent on Kubernetes or OpenShift.\n\n## Prerequisites for OpenShift\n\nBefore the agent will be able to run in OpenShift, you need to perform a couple of extra configuration steps.\n\nYou need to set up a project for the Instana Agent and configure it's permissions.\n\nThe project you create here needs to be the namespace where you create the Instana Agent custom resource that the operator will use to deploy the agent.\n\nFor example, create the `instana-agent` project:\n\n    oc new-project instana-agent\n\nThen, ensure the `instana-agent` service account is in the privileged security context:\n\n    oc adm policy add-scc-to-user privileged -z instana-agent\n\nThis service account will be created by the operator.\n\nNow you can proceed with installing the operator for the Instana agent.\n\n## Installation and Configuration\n\nFirst, install this operator from [OperatorHub.io](https://operatorhub.io/), [OpenShift Container Platform](https://www.openshift.com/), or [OKD](https://www.okd.io/).\n\nSecond, create the target namespace where the Instana agent should be installed. The agent does not need to run in the same namespace as the operator. Most users create a new namespace `instana-agent` for running the agents.\n\nThird, create a custom resource with the agent configuration in the target namespace. The operator will pick up the custom resource and install the Instana agent accordingly.\n\nThe following is a minimal template of the custom resource:\n\n```yaml\napiVersion: instana.io/v1beta1\nkind: InstanaAgent\nmetadata:\n  name: instana-agent\n  namespace: instana-agent\nspec:\n  agent.zone.name: my-zone # (optional) name of the zone of the host\n  agent.key: replace-me # replace with your Instana agent key\n  agent.endpoint.host: ingress-red-saas.instana.io # the monitoring ingress endpoint\n  agent.endpoint.port: 443 # the monitoring ingress endpoint port, wrapped in quotes\n  agent.env:\n    INSTANA_AGENT_TAGS: example\n  cluster.name: replace-me # replace with the name of your Kubernetes cluster\n  config.files:\n    configuration.yaml: |\n      # You can leave this empty, or use this to configure your instana agent.\n      # See https://docs.instana.io/setup_and_manage/host_agent/on/kubernetes/\n```\n\nSave the template in a file `instana-agent.yaml` and edit the following values:\n\n* If your target namespace is not `instana-agent`, replace the `namespace:` accordingly.\n* `agent.key` must be set with your Instana agent key.\n* `agent.endpoint` must be set with the monitoring ingress endpoint, generally either `saas-us-west-2.instana.io` or `saas-eu-west-1.instana.io`.\n* `agent.endpoint.port` must be set with the monitoring ingress port, generally \"443\" (wrapped in quotes).\n* `agent.zone.name` should be set with the name of the Kubernetes cluster that is be displayed in Instana.\n\nFor advanced configuration, you can edit the contents of the `configuration.yaml` file. View documentation [here](https://docs.instana.io/setup_and_manage/host_agent/on/kubernetes/).\n\nApply the custom resource with `kubectl apply -f instana-agent.yaml`. After some time, you should see `instana-agent` Pods being created on each node of your cluster, and your cluster should show on the infrastructure map on your Instana Web interface.\n\n## Uninstalling\n\nIn order to uninstall the Instana agent, simply remove the custom resource with `kubectl delete -f instana-agent.yaml`.\n\n## Source Code\n\nThe Instana agent operator is an open source project hosted on [https://github.com/instana/instana-agent-operator](https://github.com/instana/instana-agent-operator/).\n",

The operator aims to automate the tasks needed to run your CI/CD jobs in your container orchestration platform.\n\n## Usage\n\n To link a GitLab Runner instance to a self-hosted GitLab instance or the hosted [GitLab](https://gitlab.com), you first need to:\n\n 1. create a secret containing the `runner-registration-token` from your GitLab project.\n\n   ```\n  cat > gitlab-runner-secret.yml << EOF\n  apiVersion: v1\n  kind: Secret\n  metadata:\n    name: gitlab-runner-secret\n  type: Opaque\n  stringData:\n    runner-registration-token: REPLACE_ME # your project runner secret\n  EOF\n  ```\n\n  ```\n  oc apply -f gitlab-runner-secret.yml\n  ```\n\n 2. Create the Custom Resource Definition (CRD) file and include the following information. The tags value must be openshift for the job to run.\n\n   ```\n   cat > gitlab-runner.yml << EOF\n   apiVersion: apps.gitlab.com/v1beta2\n   kind: Runner\n   metadata:\n     name: gitlab-runner\n   spec:\n     gitlabUrl: https://gitlab.example.com\n     buildImage: alpine\n     token: gitlab-runner-secret\n     tags: openshift\n   EOF\n   ```\n\n  ```\n  oc apply -f gitlab-runner.yml\n  ```\n\n## Full documentation\n\nVisit [Install GitLab Runner on Red Hat OpenShift](https://docs.gitlab.com/runner/install/openshift.html)\n",

You can modify the NeuVector installation configuration by modifying yaml while creating the NeuVector instance such as imagePullSecrets, tag version, etc. Please refer to [NeuVector Helm Chart](https://github.com/neuvector/neuvector-helm) for the values that can be modifed during installation. To upgrade to a newer version of NeuVector, just reapply the NeuVector instance with desired tag , which in turn pulls the specified NeuVector image tags and upgrades as per upgrade plan configured on the helm chart. \n\n**Complete below steps to create secret for accessing Docker or similar registry and Grant Service Account Access to the Privileged SCC before installation.**\n\nCreate the NeuVector namespace\n\n         oc new-project  neuvector\nConfigure OpenShift to pull images from the private NeuVector registry on Docker Hub\n\n         oc create secret docker-registry regsecret -n neuvector --docker-server=https://index.docker.io/v1/ --docker-username=your-name --docker-password=your-pword --docker-email=your-email\n\t\t\t\t \n\nWhere \u2019your-name\u2019 is your Docker username, \u2019your-pword\u2019 is your Docker password, \u2019your-email\u2019 is your Docker email.\n\nLogin as system:admin account\n\n         oc login -u system:admin\n\nGrant Service Account Access to the Privileged SCC\n\n         oc -n neuvector adm policy add-scc-to-user privileged -z default\n\nThe following info will be added in the Privileged SCC users:\n\n         - system:serviceaccount:neuvector:default\n\n\n#Deploying the NeuVector Operator#\n\n\nPlease refer to the instructions [here](https://github.com/neuvector/neuvector-operator/blob/master/README.md)\n\n\n",

The NeuVector operator contains all necessary information to deploy NeuVector using helm charts. You simply need to install the NeuVector operator from the OpenShift embeded operator hub and create NeuVector instance. You can modify the NeuVector installation configuration by modifying yaml while creating the NeuVector instance such as imagePullSecrets, tag version, etc. Please refer to [NeuVector Helm Chart](https://github.com/neuvector/neuvector-helm) for the values that can be modifed during installation. To upgrade to a newer version of NeuVector, just reapply the NeuVector instance with desired tag , which in turn pulls the specified NeuVector image tags and upgrades as per upgrade plan configured on the helm chart. \n\n**Complete below steps to create secret for accessing Docker or similar registry and Grant Service Account Access to the Privileged SCC before installation.**\n\nCreate the NeuVector namespace\n\n         oc new-project  neuvector\nConfigure OpenShift to pull images from the private NeuVector registry on Docker Hub\n\n         oc create secret docker-registry regsecret -n neuvector --docker-server=https://index.docker.io/v1/ --docker-username=your-name --docker-password=your-pword --docker-email=your-email\n\t\t\t\t \n\nWhere \u2019your-name\u2019 is your Docker username, \u2019your-pword\u2019 is your Docker password, \u2019your-email\u2019 is your Docker email.\n\nLogin as system:admin account\n\n         oc login -u system:admin\n\nGrant Service Account Access to the Privileged SCC\n\n         oc -n neuvector adm policy add-scc-to-user privileged -z default\n\nThe following info will be added in the Privileged SCC users:\n\n         - system:serviceaccount:neuvector:default\n\n\n#Deploying the NeuVector Operator#\n\n\nPlease refer to the instructions [here](https://github.com/neuvector/neuvector-operator/blob/master/README.md)\n\n\n",

      "csv_description": "Cortex Certifai empowers enterprises to identify and mitigate risk and vulnerabilities within AI and deploy trusted AI systems into production. It evaluates AI models and allows users to compare different models or model versions for the following qualities.\n* **Robustness:** measures how well models retain an outcome given changes to the data feature values. The more robust a model is, the greater the changes required to alter the outcome.\n* **Fairness by group:** measures the difference required to change the outcome for different groups implicit in a feature given the same model and dataset. For example, implicit groups male, female, and nonbinary belong to the feature, \u201cgender\u201d. A fair model shows that all 3 groups require a similar amount of change to alter the results.\n* **Explainability:** measures the average simplicity of counterfactual explanations provided for each model. An explanation that requires a single changed feature will score 100%. Explanations that require more changed features will score lower.\n* **Explanations:** display the prediction provided through the generation of counterfactuals for the change that must occur in a dataset with given restrictions to obtain a different outcome. Users can explore the entire dataset one observation at a time to understand what features changed and by how much to obtain a different result.\nSee our [documentation](https://cognitivescale.github.io/cortex-certifai/) for information about how to deploy the Certifai Operator and how to get started using our toolkit.\n## License Copyright 2020 Cognitive Scale, Inc.

      "csv_description": "Cortex Certifai empowers enterprises to identify and mitigate risk and vulnerabilities within AI and deploy trusted AI systems into production. It evaluates AI models and allows users to compare different models or model versions for the following qualities.\n* **Robustness:** measures how well models retain an outcome given changes to the data feature values. The more robust a model is, the greater the changes required to alter the outcome.\n* **Fairness by group:** measures the difference required to change the outcome for different groups implicit in a feature given the same model and dataset. For example, implicit groups male, female, and nonbinary belong to the feature, \u201cgender\u201d. A fair model shows that all 3 groups require a similar amount of change to alter the results.\n* **Explainability:** measures the average simplicity of counterfactual explanations provided for each model. An explanation that requires a single changed feature will score 100%. Explanations that require more changed features will score lower.\n* **Explanations:** display the prediction provided through the generation of counterfactuals for the change that must occur in a dataset with given restrictions to obtain a different outcome. Users can explore the entire dataset one observation at a time to understand what features changed and by how much to obtain a different result.\nSee our [documentation](https://cognitivescale.github.io/cortex-certifai/) for information about how to deploy the Certifai Operator and how to get started using our toolkit.\n## License Copyright 2020 Cognitive Scale, Inc.

It evaluates AI models and allows users to compare different models or model versions for the following qualities.\n* **Robustness:** measures how well models retain an outcome given changes to the data feature values. The more robust a model is, the greater the changes required to alter the outcome.\n* **Fairness by group:** measures the difference required to change the outcome for different groups implicit in a feature given the same model and dataset. For example, implicit groups male, female, and nonbinary belong to the feature, \u201cgender\u201d. A fair model shows that all 3 groups require a similar amount of change to alter the results.\n* **Explainability:** measures the average simplicity of counterfactual explanations provided for each model. An explanation that requires a single changed feature will score 100%. Explanations that require more changed features will score lower.\n* **Explanations:** display the prediction provided through the generation of counterfactuals for the change that must occur in a dataset with given restrictions to obtain a different outcome. Users can explore the entire dataset one observation at a time to understand what features changed and by how much to obtain a different result.\nSee our [documentation](https://cognitivescale.github.io/cortex-certifai/) for information about how to deploy the Certifai Operator and how to get started using our toolkit.\n## License Copyright 2020 Cognitive Scale, Inc.

      "csv_description": "Cortex Certifai empowers enterprises to identify and mitigate risk and vulnerabilities within AI and deploy trusted AI systems into production. It evaluates AI models and allows users to compare different models or model versions for the following qualities.\n* **Robustness:** measures how well models retain an outcome given changes to the data feature values. The more robust a model is, the greater the changes required to alter the outcome.\n* **Fairness by group:** measures the difference required to change the outcome for different groups implicit in a feature given the same model and dataset. For example, implicit groups male, female, and nonbinary belong to the feature, \u201cgender\u201d. A fair model shows that all 3 groups require a similar amount of change to alter the results.\n* **Explainability:** measures the average simplicity of counterfactual explanations provided for each model. An explanation that requires a single changed feature will score 100%. Explanations that require more changed features will score lower.\n* **Explanations:** display the prediction provided through the generation of counterfactuals for the change that must occur in a dataset with given restrictions to obtain a different outcome. Users can explore the entire dataset one observation at a time to understand what features changed and by how much to obtain a different result.\nSee our [documentation](https://cognitivescale.github.io/cortex-certifai/) for information about how to deploy the Certifai Operator and how to get started using our toolkit.\n## License Copyright 2020 Cognitive Scale, Inc.

It evaluates AI models and allows users to compare different models or model versions for the following qualities.\n* **Robustness:** measures how well models retain an outcome given changes to the data feature values. The more robust a model is, the greater the changes required to alter the outcome.\n* **Fairness by group:** measures the difference required to change the outcome for different groups implicit in a feature given the same model and dataset. For example, implicit groups male, female, and nonbinary belong to the feature, \u201cgender\u201d. A fair model shows that all 3 groups require a similar amount of change to alter the results.\n* **Explainability:** measures the average simplicity of counterfactual explanations provided for each model. An explanation that requires a single changed feature will score 100%. Explanations that require more changed features will score lower.\n* **Explanations:** display the prediction provided through the generation of counterfactuals for the change that must occur in a dataset with given restrictions to obtain a different outcome. Users can explore the entire dataset one observation at a time to understand what features changed and by how much to obtain a different result.\nSee our [documentation](https://cognitivescale.github.io/cortex-certifai/) for information about how to deploy the Certifai Operator and how to get started using our toolkit.\n## License Copyright 2020 Cognitive Scale, Inc.
