Linear scalability and\nproven fault-tolerance on commodity hardware or cloud infrastructure make it the\nperfect platform for mission-critical data. Cassandra's support for replicating\nacross multiple datacenters is best-in-class, providing lower latency for your\nusers and the peace of mind of knowing that you can survive regional outages.\n\n## DataStax Enterprise\n\nThe most advanced distribution of Apache Cassandra\u2122 on the market, with the\nenterprise functionality needed for serious production systems and backed up and\nsupported by the best distributed-experts in the world. It's one platform for\nall types of applications anywhere, any cloud, any model: key-value, graph,\ntabular, JSON.\n\nDataStax Enterprise is a fully integrated and optimized database, with graph,\nanalytics, and search included, all with a unified security model. Simply put,\nit's the only database capable of meeting today's demanding requirements\n\n## Operator Details\n\n`cass-operator` is designed as a modular operator for Apache Cassandra and\nderived  distributions. Apache Cassandra is a distributed database consisting of\nmultiple nodes working in concert to store data and process queries along a\nnumber of fault domains. `cass-operator` has the deployment of a Cassandra\ncluster around the logical domain of a datacenter with the `CassandraDatacenter`\ncustom resource.\n    \nUpon submission of one of these resources it handles provisioning the underlying\nstateful sets (analogous to C\\* logical racks), services, and configuration.\nAdditionally through monitoring pod state via Kubernetes callbacks it handles day to day\noperations such as restarting failed processes, scaling clusters up, and deploying\nconfiguration changes in a rolling, non-disruptive, fashion.\n    \nThis operator is designed to be `Namespace` scoped. A single Kubernetes cluster may\nbe running multiple instances of this operator, in separate namespaces, to support\na number of C\\* clusters and environments. Configuration is simple with the usage of\nYAML based overrides in the Custom Resource paired with an `init` container.\n    \nIn C\\* clusters ordering and timing of certain operations are important to keep the system\nevenly distributed. `cass-operator` takes advantage of a sidecar process within the\nmain container to handle the orchestration of starting our main C* process.",

Linear scalability and\nproven fault-tolerance on commodity hardware or cloud infrastructure make it the\nperfect platform for mission-critical data. Cassandra's support for replicating\nacross multiple datacenters is best-in-class, providing lower latency for your\nusers and the peace of mind of knowing that you can survive regional outages.\n\n## DataStax Enterprise\n\nThe most advanced distribution of Apache Cassandra\u2122 on the market, with the\nenterprise functionality needed for serious production systems and backed up and\nsupported by the best distributed-experts in the world. It's one platform for\nall types of applications anywhere, any cloud, any model: key-value, graph,\ntabular, JSON.\n\nDataStax Enterprise is a fully integrated and optimized database, with graph,\nanalytics, and search included, all with a unified security model. Simply put,\nit's the only database capable of meeting today's demanding requirements\n\n## Operator Details\n\n`cass-operator` is designed as a modular operator for Apache Cassandra and\nderived  distributions. Apache Cassandra is a distributed database consisting of\nmultiple nodes working in concert to store data and process queries along a\nnumber of fault domains. `cass-operator` has the deployment of a Cassandra\ncluster around the logical domain of a datacenter with the `CassandraDatacenter`\ncustom resource.\n    \nUpon submission of one of these resources it handles provisioning the underlying\nstateful sets (analogous to C\\* logical racks), services, and configuration.\nAdditionally through monitoring pod state via Kubernetes callbacks it handles day to day\noperations such as restarting failed processes, scaling clusters up, and deploying\nconfiguration changes in a rolling, non-disruptive, fashion.\n    \nThis operator is designed to be `Namespace` scoped. A single Kubernetes cluster may\nbe running multiple instances of this operator, in separate namespaces, to support\na number of C\\* clusters and environments. Configuration is simple with the usage of\nYAML based overrides in the Custom Resource paired with an `init` container.\n    \nIn C\\* clusters ordering and timing of certain operations are important to keep the system\nevenly distributed. `cass-operator` takes advantage of a sidecar process within the\nmain container to handle the orchestration of starting our main C* process.",

Linear scalability and\nproven fault-tolerance on commodity hardware or cloud infrastructure make it the\nperfect platform for mission-critical data. Cassandra's support for replicating\nacross multiple datacenters is best-in-class, providing lower latency for your\nusers and the peace of mind of knowing that you can survive regional outages.\n\n## DataStax Enterprise\n\nThe most advanced distribution of Apache Cassandra\u2122 on the market, with the\nenterprise functionality needed for serious production systems and backed up and\nsupported by the best distributed-experts in the world. It's one platform for\nall types of applications anywhere, any cloud, any model: key-value, graph,\ntabular, JSON.\n\nDataStax Enterprise is a fully integrated and optimized database, with graph,\nanalytics, and search included, all with a unified security model. Simply put,\nit's the only database capable of meeting today's demanding requirements\n\n## Operator Details\n\n`cass-operator` is designed as a modular operator for Apache Cassandra and\nderived  distributions. Apache Cassandra is a distributed database consisting of\nmultiple nodes working in concert to store data and process queries along a\nnumber of fault domains. `cass-operator` has the deployment of a Cassandra\ncluster around the logical domain of a datacenter with the `CassandraDatacenter`\ncustom resource.\n    \nUpon submission of one of these resources it handles provisioning the underlying\nstateful sets (analogous to C\\* logical racks), services, and configuration.\nAdditionally through monitoring pod state via Kubernetes callbacks it handles day to day\noperations such as restarting failed processes, scaling clusters up, and deploying\nconfiguration changes in a rolling, non-disruptive, fashion.\n    \nThis operator is designed to be `Namespace` scoped. A single Kubernetes cluster may\nbe running multiple instances of this operator, in separate namespaces, to support\na number of C\\* clusters and environments. Configuration is simple with the usage of\nYAML based overrides in the Custom Resource paired with an `init` container.\n    \nIn C\\* clusters ordering and timing of certain operations are important to keep the system\nevenly distributed. `cass-operator` takes advantage of a sidecar process within the\nmain container to handle the orchestration of starting our main C* process.",

      "csv_description": "Apache CouchDB lets you access your data where you need it. The [Couch Replication Protocol](http://docs.couchdb.org/en/master/replication/protocol.html) is implemented in a variety of projects and products that span every imaginable computing environment from globally distributed server-clusters, over mobile phones to web browsers.\n\nStore your data safely, on your own servers, or with any leading cloud provider. Your web- and native applications love CouchDB, because it speaks JSON natively and supports binary data for all your data storage needs.\n\nThe [Couch Replication Protocol](http://docs.couchdb.org/en/master/replication/protocol.html) lets your data flow seamlessly between server clusters to mobile phones and web browsers, enabling a compelling [offline-first](http://offlinefirst.org/) user-experience while maintaining high performance and strong reliability. CouchDB comes with a developer-friendly query language, and optionally MapReduce for simple, efficient, and comprehensive data retrieval.\n\n### Operator for Apache CouchDB Features\n* Fully automated deployment and configuration of Apache CouchDB clusters.\n* Support single, multiple, or all namespace install modes.\n\n#### Security\n* TLS - TLS  is supported using Red Hat Service certificates or user-provided certificates.\n* Authentication - The parameter `require_valid_user` defaults to `true`, which means that no requests are allowed from anonymous users. Every request must be authenticated.\n* Authorization - Databases are initially accessible by Apache CouchDB admins only.\n\n#### High Availability\n* Nodes - Each database node in an Apache CouchDB cluster requires its own Kubernetes node. It's recommended that you run it with a minimum of three nodes for any production deployment.\n* Zones - The Apache CouchDB cluster database nodes are spread across available Kubernetes fault zones where available.\n* Replicas - The default configuration for each database is two shards (Q=2) and three shard copies (N=3), where each shard copy is deployed on a separate node in the cluster.\n\n### Reading and writing to Apache CouchDB\n\nThe Operator for Apache CouchDB automatically generates a Service. This can be accessed using port-forwarding e.g. `kubectl port-forward svc/my-couchdb-cluster 443:443 -u admin:mypassword`. Alternatively, configure an OpenShift Route to expose the service externally.\n\n### CouchDB 2.3.1 Update Instructions\nWhen the operator is updated to v2.0 or above any existing CouchDB 2.3.1 cluster will not be automatically upgraded to CouchDB 3. The user must manually trigger this process by removing the version statement `version: 2.3.1` in the CouchDBCluster CR for each CouchDB cluster\nThe operator will then perform a rolling update, with the new pods running CouchDB3.\nIt is advised that customers do this straightaway as CouchDB 2.3.1 is no longer supported.\n\n[Read the complete guide to using the Operator for Apache CouchDB](https://ibm.biz/BdfGQy)\n",

The [Couch Replication Protocol](http://docs.couchdb.org/en/master/replication/protocol.html) is implemented in a variety of projects and products that span every imaginable computing environment from globally distributed server-clusters, over mobile phones to web browsers.\n\nStore your data safely, on your own servers, or with any leading cloud provider. Your web- and native applications love CouchDB, because it speaks JSON natively and supports binary data for all your data storage needs.\n\nThe [Couch Replication Protocol](http://docs.couchdb.org/en/master/replication/protocol.html) lets your data flow seamlessly between server clusters to mobile phones and web browsers, enabling a compelling [offline-first](http://offlinefirst.org/) user-experience while maintaining high performance and strong reliability. CouchDB comes with a developer-friendly query language, and optionally MapReduce for simple, efficient, and comprehensive data retrieval.\n\n### Operator for Apache CouchDB Features\n* Fully automated deployment and configuration of Apache CouchDB clusters.\n* Support single, multiple, or all namespace install modes.\n\n#### Security\n* TLS - TLS  is supported using Red Hat Service certificates or user-provided certificates.\n* Authentication - The parameter `require_valid_user` defaults to `true`, which means that no requests are allowed from anonymous users. Every request must be authenticated.\n* Authorization - Databases are initially accessible by Apache CouchDB admins only.\n\n#### High Availability\n* Nodes - Each database node in an Apache CouchDB cluster requires its own Kubernetes node. It's recommended that you run it with a minimum of three nodes for any production deployment.\n* Zones - The Apache CouchDB cluster database nodes are spread across available Kubernetes fault zones where available.\n* Replicas - The default configuration for each database is two shards (Q=2) and three shard copies (N=3), where each shard copy is deployed on a separate node in the cluster.\n\n### Reading and writing to Apache CouchDB\n\nThe Operator for Apache CouchDB automatically generates a Service. This can be accessed using port-forwarding e.g. `kubectl port-forward svc/my-couchdb-cluster 443:443 -u admin:mypassword`. Alternatively, configure an OpenShift Route to expose the service externally.\n\n### CouchDB 2.3.1 Update Instructions\nWhen the operator is updated to v2.0 or above any existing CouchDB 2.3.1 cluster will not be automatically upgraded to CouchDB 3. The user must manually trigger this process by removing the version statement `version: 2.3.1` in the CouchDBCluster CR for each CouchDB cluster\nThe operator will then perform a rolling update, with the new pods running CouchDB3.\nIt is advised that customers do this straightaway as CouchDB 2.3.1 is no longer supported.\n\n[Read the complete guide to using the Operator for Apache CouchDB](https://ibm.biz/BdfGQy)\n",

      "csv_description": "Apache CouchDB lets you access your data where you need it. The [Couch Replication Protocol](http://docs.couchdb.org/en/master/replication/protocol.html) is implemented in a variety of projects and products that span every imaginable computing environment from globally distributed server-clusters, over mobile phones to web browsers.\n\nStore your data safely, on your own servers, or with any leading cloud provider. Your web- and native applications love CouchDB, because it speaks JSON natively and supports binary data for all your data storage needs.\n\nThe [Couch Replication Protocol](http://docs.couchdb.org/en/master/replication/protocol.html) lets your data flow seamlessly between server clusters to mobile phones and web browsers, enabling a compelling [offline-first](http://offlinefirst.org/) user-experience while maintaining high performance and strong reliability. CouchDB comes with a developer-friendly query language, and optionally MapReduce for simple, efficient, and comprehensive data retrieval.\n\n### Operator for Apache CouchDB Features\n* Fully automated deployment and configuration of Apache CouchDB clusters.\n* Support single, multiple, or all namespace install modes.\n\n#### Security\n* TLS - TLS  is supported using Red Hat Service certificates or user-provided certificates.\n* Authentication - The parameter `require_valid_user` defaults to `true`, which means that no requests are allowed from anonymous users. Every request must be authenticated.\n* Authorization - Databases are initially accessible by Apache CouchDB admins only.\n\n#### High Availability\n* Nodes - Each database node in an Apache CouchDB cluster requires its own Kubernetes node. It's recommended that you run it with a minimum of three nodes for any production deployment.\n* Zones - The Apache CouchDB cluster database nodes are spread across available Kubernetes fault zones where available.\n* Replicas - The default configuration for each database is two shards (Q=2) and three shard copies (N=3), where each shard copy is deployed on a separate node in the cluster.\n\n### Reading and writing to Apache CouchDB\n\nThe Operator for Apache CouchDB automatically generates a Service. This can be accessed using port-forwarding e.g. `kubectl port-forward svc/my-couchdb-cluster 443:443 -u admin:mypassword`. Alternatively, configure an OpenShift Route to expose the service externally.\n\n### CouchDB 2.3.1 Update Instructions\nWhen the operator is updated to v2.0 or above any existing CouchDB 2.3.1 cluster will not be automatically upgraded to CouchDB 3. The user must manually trigger this process by removing the version statement `version: 2.3.1` in the CouchDBCluster CR for each CouchDB cluster\nThe operator will then perform a rolling update, with the new pods running CouchDB3.\nIt is advised that customers do this straightaway as CouchDB 2.3.1 is no longer supported.\n\n[Read the complete guide to using the Operator for Apache CouchDB](https://ibm.biz/BdfGQy)\n",

Linear scalability and\nproven fault-tolerance on commodity hardware or cloud infrastructure make it the\nperfect platform for mission-critical data. Cassandra's support for replicating\nacross multiple datacenters is best-in-class, providing lower latency for your\nusers and the peace of mind of knowing that you can survive regional outages.\n\n## DataStax Enterprise\n\nThe most advanced distribution of Apache Cassandra\u2122 on the market, with the\nenterprise functionality needed for serious production systems and backed up and\nsupported by the best distributed-experts in the world. It's one platform for\nall types of applications anywhere, any cloud, any model: key-value, graph,\ntabular, JSON.\n\nDataStax Enterprise is a fully integrated and optimized database, with graph,\nanalytics, and search included, all with a unified security model. Simply put,\nit's the only database capable of meeting today's demanding requirements\n\n## Operator Details\n\n`cass-operator` is designed as a modular operator for Apache Cassandra and\nderived  distributions. Apache Cassandra is a distributed database consisting of\nmultiple nodes working in concert to store data and process queries along a\nnumber of fault domains. `cass-operator` has the deployment of a Cassandra\ncluster around the logical domain of a datacenter with the `CassandraDatacenter`\ncustom resource.\n    \nUpon submission of one of these resources it handles provisioning the underlying\nstateful sets (analogous to C\\* logical racks), services, and configuration.\nAdditionally through monitoring pod state via Kubernetes callbacks it handles day to day\noperations such as restarting failed processes, scaling clusters up, and deploying\nconfiguration changes in a rolling, non-disruptive, fashion.\n    \nThis operator is designed to be `Namespace` scoped. A single Kubernetes cluster may\nbe running multiple instances of this operator, in separate namespaces, to support\na number of C\\* clusters and environments. Configuration is simple with the usage of\nYAML based overrides in the Custom Resource paired with an `init` container.\n    \nIn C\\* clusters ordering and timing of certain operations are important to keep the system\nevenly distributed. `cass-operator` takes advantage of a sidecar process within the\nmain container to handle the orchestration of starting our main C* process.",

      "csv_description": "Apache CouchDB lets you access your data where you need it. The [Couch Replication Protocol](http://docs.couchdb.org/en/master/replication/protocol.html) is implemented in a variety of projects and products that span every imaginable computing environment from globally distributed server-clusters, over mobile phones to web browsers.\n\nStore your data safely, on your own servers, or with any leading cloud provider. Your web- and native applications love CouchDB, because it speaks JSON natively and supports binary data for all your data storage needs.\n\nThe [Couch Replication Protocol](http://docs.couchdb.org/en/master/replication/protocol.html) lets your data flow seamlessly between server clusters to mobile phones and web browsers, enabling a compelling [offline-first](http://offlinefirst.org/) user-experience while maintaining high performance and strong reliability. CouchDB comes with a developer-friendly query language, and optionally MapReduce for simple, efficient, and comprehensive data retrieval.\n\n### Operator for Apache CouchDB Features\n* Fully automated deployment and configuration of Apache CouchDB clusters.\n* Support single, multiple, or all namespace install modes.\n\n#### Security\n* TLS - TLS  is supported using Red Hat Service certificates or user-provided certificates.\n* Authentication - The parameter `require_valid_user` defaults to `true`, which means that no requests are allowed from anonymous users. Every request must be authenticated.\n* Authorization - Databases are initially accessible by Apache CouchDB admins only.\n\n#### High Availability\n* Nodes - Each database node in an Apache CouchDB cluster requires its own Kubernetes node. It's recommended that you run it with a minimum of three nodes for any production deployment.\n* Zones - The Apache CouchDB cluster database nodes are spread across available Kubernetes fault zones where available.\n* Replicas - The default configuration for each database is two shards (Q=2) and three shard copies (N=3), where each shard copy is deployed on a separate node in the cluster.\n\n### Reading and writing to Apache CouchDB\n\nThe Operator for Apache CouchDB automatically generates a Service. This can be accessed using port-forwarding e.g. `kubectl port-forward svc/my-couchdb-cluster 443:443 -u admin:mypassword`. Alternatively, configure an OpenShift Route to expose the service externally.\n\n### CouchDB 2.3.1 Update Instructions\nWhen the operator is updated to v2.0 or above any existing CouchDB 2.3.1 cluster will not be automatically upgraded to CouchDB 3. The user must manually trigger this process by removing the version statement `version: 2.3.1` in the CouchDBCluster CR for each CouchDB cluster\nThe operator will then perform a rolling update, with the new pods running CouchDB3.\nIt is advised that customers do this straightaway as CouchDB 2.3.1 is no longer supported.\n\n[Read the complete guide to using the Operator for Apache CouchDB](https://ibm.biz/BdfGQy)\n",

The [Couch Replication Protocol](http://docs.couchdb.org/en/master/replication/protocol.html) is implemented in a variety of projects and products that span every imaginable computing environment from globally distributed server-clusters, over mobile phones to web browsers.\n\nStore your data safely, on your own servers, or with any leading cloud provider. Your web- and native applications love CouchDB, because it speaks JSON natively and supports binary data for all your data storage needs.\n\nThe [Couch Replication Protocol](http://docs.couchdb.org/en/master/replication/protocol.html) lets your data flow seamlessly between server clusters to mobile phones and web browsers, enabling a compelling [offline-first](http://offlinefirst.org/) user-experience while maintaining high performance and strong reliability. CouchDB comes with a developer-friendly query language, and optionally MapReduce for simple, efficient, and comprehensive data retrieval.\n\n### Operator for Apache CouchDB Features\n* Fully automated deployment and configuration of Apache CouchDB clusters.\n* Support single, multiple, or all namespace install modes.\n\n#### Security\n* TLS - TLS  is supported using Red Hat Service certificates or user-provided certificates.\n* Authentication - The parameter `require_valid_user` defaults to `true`, which means that no requests are allowed from anonymous users. Every request must be authenticated.\n* Authorization - Databases are initially accessible by Apache CouchDB admins only.\n\n#### High Availability\n* Nodes - Each database node in an Apache CouchDB cluster requires its own Kubernetes node. It's recommended that you run it with a minimum of three nodes for any production deployment.\n* Zones - The Apache CouchDB cluster database nodes are spread across available Kubernetes fault zones where available.\n* Replicas - The default configuration for each database is two shards (Q=2) and three shard copies (N=3), where each shard copy is deployed on a separate node in the cluster.\n\n### Reading and writing to Apache CouchDB\n\nThe Operator for Apache CouchDB automatically generates a Service. This can be accessed using port-forwarding e.g. `kubectl port-forward svc/my-couchdb-cluster 443:443 -u admin:mypassword`. Alternatively, configure an OpenShift Route to expose the service externally.\n\n### CouchDB 2.3.1 Update Instructions\nWhen the operator is updated to v2.0 or above any existing CouchDB 2.3.1 cluster will not be automatically upgraded to CouchDB 3. The user must manually trigger this process by removing the version statement `version: 2.3.1` in the CouchDBCluster CR for each CouchDB cluster\nThe operator will then perform a rolling update, with the new pods running CouchDB3.\nIt is advised that customers do this straightaway as CouchDB 2.3.1 is no longer supported.\n\n[Read the complete guide to using the Operator for Apache CouchDB](https://ibm.biz/BdfGQy)\n",

      "csv_description": "Apache CouchDB lets you access your data where you need it. The [Couch Replication Protocol](http://docs.couchdb.org/en/master/replication/protocol.html) is implemented in a variety of projects and products that span every imaginable computing environment from globally distributed server-clusters, over mobile phones to web browsers.\n\nStore your data safely, on your own servers, or with any leading cloud provider. Your web- and native applications love CouchDB, because it speaks JSON natively and supports binary data for all your data storage needs.\n\nThe [Couch Replication Protocol](http://docs.couchdb.org/en/master/replication/protocol.html) lets your data flow seamlessly between server clusters to mobile phones and web browsers, enabling a compelling [offline-first](http://offlinefirst.org/) user-experience while maintaining high performance and strong reliability. CouchDB comes with a developer-friendly query language, and optionally MapReduce for simple, efficient, and comprehensive data retrieval.\n\n### Operator for Apache CouchDB Features\n* Fully automated deployment and configuration of Apache CouchDB clusters.\n* Support single, multiple, or all namespace install modes.\n\n#### Security\n* TLS - TLS  is supported using Red Hat Service certificates or user-provided certificates.\n* Authentication - The parameter `require_valid_user` defaults to `true`, which means that no requests are allowed from anonymous users. Every request must be authenticated.\n* Authorization - Databases are initially accessible by Apache CouchDB admins only.\n\n#### High Availability\n* Nodes - Each database node in an Apache CouchDB cluster requires its own Kubernetes node. It's recommended that you run it with a minimum of three nodes for any production deployment.\n* Zones - The Apache CouchDB cluster database nodes are spread across available Kubernetes fault zones where available.\n* Replicas - The default configuration for each database is two shards (Q=2) and three shard copies (N=3), where each shard copy is deployed on a separate node in the cluster.\n\n### Reading and writing to Apache CouchDB\n\nThe Operator for Apache CouchDB automatically generates a Service. This can be accessed using port-forwarding e.g. `kubectl port-forward svc/my-couchdb-cluster 443:443 -u admin:mypassword`. Alternatively, configure an OpenShift Route to expose the service externally.\n\n### CouchDB 2.3.1 Update Instructions\nWhen the operator is updated to v2.0 or above any existing CouchDB 2.3.1 cluster will not be automatically upgraded to CouchDB 3. The user must manually trigger this process by removing the version statement `version: 2.3.1` in the CouchDBCluster CR for each CouchDB cluster\nThe operator will then perform a rolling update, with the new pods running CouchDB3.\nIt is advised that customers do this straightaway as CouchDB 2.3.1 is no longer supported.\n\n[Read the complete guide to using the Operator for Apache CouchDB](https://ibm.biz/BdfGQy)\n",

      "csv_description": "# Instana\n\nInstana is an [APM solution](https://www.instana.com/product-overview/) built for microservices that enables IT Ops to build applications faster and deliver higher quality services by automating monitoring, tracing and root cause analysis. The solution is optimized for [Kubernetes](https://www.instana.com/automatic-kubernetes-monitoring/) and [OpenShift](https://www.instana.com/blog/automatic-root-cause-analysis-for-openshift-applications/).\n\n## Instana Agent Operator\n\nThis is the Kubernetes Operator for installing the Instana Agent on Kubernetes or OpenShift.\n\n## Prerequisites for OpenShift\n\nBefore the agent will be able to run in OpenShift, you need to perform a couple of extra configuration steps.\n\nYou need to set up a project for the Instana Agent and configure it's permissions.\n\nThe project you create here needs to be the namespace where you create the Instana Agent custom resource that the operator will use to deploy the agent.\n\nFor example, create the `instana-agent` project:\n\n    oc new-project instana-agent\n\nThen, ensure the `instana-agent` service account is in the privileged security context:\n\n    oc adm policy add-scc-to-user privileged -z instana-agent\n\nThis service account will be created by the operator.\n\nNow you can proceed with installing the operator for the Instana agent.\n\n## Installation and Configuration\n\nFirst, install this operator from [OperatorHub.io](https://operatorhub.io/), [OpenShift Container Platform](https://www.openshift.com/), or [OKD](https://www.okd.io/).\n\nSecond, create a custom resource with the agent configuration in the target namespace (for now, this MUST always be the `instana-agent` namespace). The operator will pick up the custom resource and install the Instana agent accordingly.\n\nThe following is a minimal template of the custom resource:\n\n```yaml\napiVersion: instana.io/v1\nkind: InstanaAgent\nmetadata:\n  name: instana-agent\n  namespace: instana-agent\nspec:\n  zone:\n    name: my-zone # (optional) name of the zone of the host\n  cluster:\n    name: replace-me # replace with the name of your Kubernetes cluster\n  agent:\n    key: replace-me # replace with your Instana agent key\n    endpointHost: ingress-red-saas.instana.io # the monitoring ingress endpoint\n    endpointPort: \"443\" # the monitoring ingress endpoint port, wrapped in quotes\n    env:\n      INSTANA_AGENT_TAGS: example\n    configuration_yaml: |\n      # You can leave this empty, or use this to configure your instana agent.\n      # See https://docs.instana.io/setup_and_manage/host_agent/on/kubernetes/\n```\n\nSave the template in a file `instana-agent.yaml` and edit the following values:\n\n* If your target namespace is not `instana-agent`, replace the `namespace:` accordingly.\n* `agent.key` must be set with your Instana agent key.\n* `agent.endpointHost` must be set with the monitoring ingress endpoint, generally either `saas-us-west-2.instana.io` or `saas-eu-west-1.instana.io`.\n* `agent.endpointPort` must be set with the monitoring ingress port, generally \"443\" (wrapped in quotes).\n* `zone.name` should be set with the name of the Kubernetes cluster that is be displayed in Instana.\n\nFor advanced configuration, you can edit the contents of the `configuration.yaml` file. View documentation [here](https://docs.instana.io/setup_and_manage/host_agent/on/kubernetes/).\n\nApply the custom resource with `kubectl apply -f instana-agent.yaml`. After some time, you should see `instana-agent` Pods being created on each node of your cluster, and your cluster should show on the infrastructure map on your Instana Web interface.\n\n## Uninstalling\n\nIn order to uninstall the Instana agent, simply remove the custom resource with `kubectl delete -f instana-agent.yaml`.\n\n## Source Code\n\nThe Instana agent operator is an open source project hosted on [https://github.com/instana/instana-agent-operator](https://github.com/instana/instana-agent-operator/).\n",

      "csv_description": "# Instana\n\nInstana is an [APM solution](https://www.instana.com/product-overview/) built for microservices that enables IT Ops to build applications faster and deliver higher quality services by automating monitoring, tracing and root cause analysis. The solution is optimized for [Kubernetes](https://www.instana.com/automatic-kubernetes-monitoring/) and [OpenShift](https://www.instana.com/blog/automatic-root-cause-analysis-for-openshift-applications/).\n\n## Instana Agent Operator\n\nThis is the Kubernetes Operator for installing the Instana Agent on Kubernetes or OpenShift.\n\n## Prerequisites for OpenShift\n\nBefore the agent will be able to run in OpenShift, you need to perform a couple of extra configuration steps.\n\nYou need to set up a project for the Instana Agent and configure it's permissions.\n\nThe project you create here needs to be the namespace where you create the Instana Agent custom resource that the operator will use to deploy the agent.\n\nFor example, create the `instana-agent` project:\n\n    oc new-project instana-agent\n\nThen, ensure the `instana-agent` service account is in the privileged security context:\n\n    oc adm policy add-scc-to-user privileged -z instana-agent\n\nThis service account will be created by the operator.\n\nNow you can proceed with installing the operator for the Instana agent.\n\n## Installation and Configuration\n\nFirst, install this operator from [OperatorHub.io](https://operatorhub.io/), [OpenShift Container Platform](https://www.openshift.com/), or [OKD](https://www.okd.io/).\n\nSecond, create a custom resource with the agent configuration in the target namespace (for now, this MUST always be the `instana-agent` namespace). The operator will pick up the custom resource and install the Instana agent accordingly.\n\nThe following is a minimal template of the custom resource:\n\n```yaml\napiVersion: instana.io/v1\nkind: InstanaAgent\nmetadata:\n  name: instana-agent\n  namespace: instana-agent\nspec:\n  zone:\n    name: my-zone # (optional) name of the zone of the host\n  cluster:\n    name: replace-me # replace with the name of your Kubernetes cluster\n  agent:\n    key: replace-me # replace with your Instana agent key\n    endpointHost: ingress-red-saas.instana.io # the monitoring ingress endpoint\n    endpointPort: \"443\" # the monitoring ingress endpoint port, wrapped in quotes\n    env:\n      INSTANA_AGENT_TAGS: example\n    configuration_yaml: |\n      # You can leave this empty, or use this to configure your instana agent.\n      # See https://docs.instana.io/setup_and_manage/host_agent/on/kubernetes/\n```\n\nSave the template in a file `instana-agent.yaml` and edit the following values:\n\n* If your target namespace is not `instana-agent`, replace the `namespace:` accordingly.\n* `agent.key` must be set with your Instana agent key.\n* `agent.endpointHost` must be set with the monitoring ingress endpoint, generally either `saas-us-west-2.instana.io` or `saas-eu-west-1.instana.io`.\n* `agent.endpointPort` must be set with the monitoring ingress port, generally \"443\" (wrapped in quotes).\n* `zone.name` should be set with the name of the Kubernetes cluster that is be displayed in Instana.\n\nFor advanced configuration, you can edit the contents of the `configuration.yaml` file. View documentation [here](https://docs.instana.io/setup_and_manage/host_agent/on/kubernetes/).\n\nApply the custom resource with `kubectl apply -f instana-agent.yaml`. After some time, you should see `instana-agent` Pods being created on each node of your cluster, and your cluster should show on the infrastructure map on your Instana Web interface.\n\n## Uninstalling\n\nIn order to uninstall the Instana agent, simply remove the custom resource with `kubectl delete -f instana-agent.yaml`.\n\n## Source Code\n\nThe Instana agent operator is an open source project hosted on [https://github.com/instana/instana-agent-operator](https://github.com/instana/instana-agent-operator/).\n",

Create tokens of type *Dynatrace API* (`API_TOKEN`) and *Platform as a Service* (`PAAS_TOKEN`) and use their values in the following commands respectively.\n\nFor assistance please refer to [Create user-generated access tokens](https://www.dynatrace.com/support/help/shortlink/token#create-user-generated-access-tokens).\n\n``` $ oc -n <project> create secret generic dynakube --from-literal=\"apiToken=API_TOKEN\" --from-literal=\"paasToken=PAAS_TOKEN\" ```\n\nYou may update this Secret at any time to rotate the tokens.\n\nAfter creation of the secret add the DynaKube object in the project where the Dynatrace Operator has been deployed, configured to your needs.\n\n### Required Parameters\n* `apiUrl` - provide the URL to the API of your Dynatrace environment. In Dynatrace SaaS it will look like `https://<ENVIRONMENTID>.live.dynatrace.com/api` . In Dynatrace Managed like `https://<YourDynatraceServerURL>/e/<ENVIRONMENTID>/api` .\n\n### Advanced Options\n* **Disable Certificate Checking** - disable any certificate validation that may interact poorly with proxies with in your cluster\n* **Image Override** - use a copy of the ActiveGate container image from a registry other than Docker's or Red Hat's\n\nFor a complete list of supported parameters please consult the [Operator Deploy Guide](https://www.dynatrace.com/support/help/shortlink/openshift-deploy).\n\n### Help\nYou can find more about our instructions in our [documentation](https://www.dynatrace.com/support/help/shortlink/openshift-deploy#install-dynatrace-operator).\n",

The version of Rabbitmq that this chart uses has significantly changed from version 1.1.8 of the operator.\nFor full details on how to migrate please visit:\n`https://github.com/jfrog/charts/blob/master/stable/xray/RABBITMQ_MIGRATION_NOTES.md`\n### Security Context Constraints\nTo deploy this helm chart you will need to be a cluster admin w/ access to the anyuid scc and add the operator service account to the anyuid scc.\n\n```\noc adm policy add-scc-to-user anyuid -z xray-operator\n```\n```\noc adm policy add-scc-to-user anyuid -z openshiftxray\n```\n```\noc adm policy add-scc-to-user anyuid -z openshiftxray-rabbitmq-ha\n```\n\n## Usage\n\nAn external DB is required. The operator will not deploy a DB but will require you to specify the configuration values to connect to it.\n\nSearch for JFrog and click JFrog Xray Operator to install.\n\nGo to the Installed Operators.\n\nWait for the JFrog Xray Operator to complete the installation.\n\nOpen the Operator and click on the provided API: Xray\n\nClick Create New Instance and provide the following parameters for your DB configuration:\n\n```\nJFROG_URL\nDATABASE_URL\nDATABASE_USER\nDATABASE_PASSWORD\n```\n\nJFROG_URL is the external ip or DNS of your Artifactory to connect Xray to. Artifactory is required to use this operator.\nYou can set your JFROG_URL to the service name of your Artifactory Nginx:\n``` oc get svc -n my_namespace | grep nginx ```\nDATABASE_URL must be a Postgresql URL in the format:\n``\npostgres://postgres-postgresql:5432/xraydb?sslmode=disable\n``\nDATABASE_USER and DATABASE_PASSWORD must supply a valid user on Postgresql.\n\nClick Create for Xray to deploy into OpenShift.\n\nOpen Artifactory in a web browser to complete the onboarding wizard for Xray!\n\n### Air gap environments\n\nTo use Xray Operator in an air gap environment you will need to download the images as image streams into your Openshift air gap cluster manually.\n\nUse the image overrides to then specify the image stream locations that are local to your cluster.\n\nNext you will need to setup the database of index data for xray to use when scanning artifacts.\n\nFollow the link below for instructions on setup:\n\nhttps://www.jfrog.com/confluence/display/JFROG/Configuring+Xray#ConfiguringXray-SynchronizingtheDatabase\n\n",

Anchore Engine allows \n users to perform detailed analysis on their container images, run queries, produce reports, and define policies that \n can be used in CI/CD pipelines. Users can extend Anchore Engine with plugins that add new queries, image analysis, and \n policies. Anchore Engine can be accessed directly through a RESTful API or via the Anchore CLI.\n\n The Anchore Engine Operator is based on the official stable [Helm Chart](https://github.com/anchore/anchore-charts/tree/master/stable/anchore-engine).",
