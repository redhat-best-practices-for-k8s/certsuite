    "description": "Deploys an nginx server configured to accept only TLS 1.3 connections. Under the Intermediate profile (the default on non-OCP clusters), the server must accept all versions from TLS 1.2 upward. A TLS 1.3-only server rejects TLS 1.2 and is therefore non-compliant. This scenario verifies that overly restrictive servers are correctly flagged.",

    "description": "Deploys an nginx server configured to accept both TLS 1.2 and TLS 1.3 connections, restricted to only the cipher suites allowed by the Intermediate TLS security profile. On non-OpenShift clusters (including CI), the test defaults to the Intermediate profile (min TLS 1.2). Since this server meets both the minimum version and cipher requirements, it is compliant. Note: this same server would be non-compliant under a Modern profile (which requires TLS 1.3), but that is covered by unit tests rather than CI scenarios.",
