These can be configured through the following config file. - tnf_config.yml Sample As per the requirement the following fields can be changed. targetNameSpaces \u00b6 Multiple namespaces can be specified to deploy partner pods for testing through targetNameSpaces in the config file. targetNameSpaces : - name : firstnamespace - name : secondnamespace targetPodLabels \u00b6 The goal of this section is to specify the labels to be used to identify the CNF resources under test. Highly recommended The labels should be defined in pod definition rather than added after pod is created, as labels added later on will be lost in case the pod gets rescheduled. In case of pods defined as part of a deployment, it\u2019s best to use the same label as the one defined in the spec.selector.matchLabels section of the deployment yaml. The prefix field can be used to avoid naming collision with other labels. targetPodLabels : - prefix : test-network-function.com name : generic value : target The corresponding pod label used to match pods is: test-network-function.com/generic : target Once the pods are found, all of their containers are also added to the target container list. A target deployment list will also be created with all the deployments which the test pods belong to. targetCrds \u00b6 In order to autodiscover the CRDs to be tested, an array of search filters can be set under the \u201ctargetCrdFilters\u201d label. The autodiscovery mechanism will iterate through all the filters to look for all the CRDs that match it. Currently, filters only work by name suffix. targetCrdFilters : - nameSuffix : \"group1.tnf.com\" - nameSuffix : \"anydomain.com\" The autodiscovery mechanism will create a list of all CRD names in the cluster whose names have the suffix group1.tnf.com or anydomain.com , e.g. crd1.group1.tnf.com or mycrd.mygroup.anydomain.com . testTarget \u00b6 podsUnderTest / containersUnderTest \u00b6 The autodiscovery mechanism will attempt to identify the default network device and all the IP addresses of the pods it needs for network connectivity tests, though that information can be explicitly set using annotations if needed. Pod IPs \u00b6 The k8s.v1.cni.cncf.io/networks-status annotation is checked and all IPs from it are used. This annotation is automatically managed in OpenShift but may not be present in K8s. If it is not present, then only known IPs associated with the pod are used (the pod .status.ips field). Network Interfaces \u00b6 The k8s.v1.cni.cncf.io/networks-status annotation is checked and the interface from the first entry found with \"default\"=true is used. This annotation is automatically managed in OpenShift but may not be present in K8s. The label test-network-function.com/skip_connectivity_tests excludes pods from all connectivity tests. The label value is not important, only its presence. The label test-network-function.com/skip_multus_connectivity_tests excludes pods from Multus connectivity tests. Tests on default interface are still done. The label value is not important, but its presence. AffinityRequired \u00b6 For CNF workloads that require pods to use Pod or Node Affinity rules, the label AffinityRequired: true must be included on the Pod YAML. This will prevent any tests for anti-affinity to fail as well as test your workloads for affinity rules that support your CNF \u2018s use-case. certifiedcontainerinfo \u00b6 The certifiedcontainerinfo section contains information about CNFs containers that are to be checked for certification status on Red Hat catalogs. Operators \u00b6 The CSV of the installed Operators can be tested by the operator and affiliated-certification specs are identified with the test-network-function.com/operator=target label. Any value is permitted here but target is used here for consistency with the other specs. AllowedProtocolNames \u00b6 This name of protocols that allowed. If we want to add another name, we just need to write the name in the yaml file. for example: if we want to add new protocol - \u201chttp4\u201d, we add in \u201ctnf_config.yml\u201d below \u201cvalidProtocolNames\u201d and then this protocol (\u201chttp4\u201d) add to map allowedProtocolNames and finally \u201chttp4\u201d will be allow protocol.","title":"Test Configuration"},{"location":"configuration/#test-configuration","text":"The certification test suite supports autodiscovery using labels and annotations.

It also tests the pods/containers configuration. 4.6.0 affiliated-certification The affiliated-certification test suite verifies that the containers and operators discovered or listed in the configuration file are certified by Redhat 4.6.0 lifecycle The lifecycle test suite verifies the pods deployment, creation, shutdown and survivability. 4.6.0 networking The networking test suite contains tests that check connectivity and networking config related best practices. 4.6.0 operator The operator test suite is designed to test basic Kubernetes Operator functionality. 4.6.0 platform-alteration verifies that key platform configuration is not modified by the CNF under test 4.6.0 observability the observability test suite contains tests that check CNF logging is following best practices and that CRDs have status fields 4.6.0 Info Please refer CATALOG.md for more details.

They do NOT test the CNF . 3. Test a CNF \u00b6 A CNF is tested by specifying which suites to run using the run-cnf-suites.sh helper script. Run any combination of the suites keywords listed at in the General tests section, e.g. ./run-cnf-suites.sh -l \"lifecycle\" ./run-cnf-suites.sh -l \"networking,lifecycle\" ./run-cnf-suites.sh -l \"operator,networking\" ./run-cnf-suites.sh -l \"networking,platform-alteration\" ./run-cnf-suites.sh -l \"networking,lifecycle,affiliated-certification,operator\" Note As with \u201crun-tnf-container.sh\u201d, if -l is not specified here, the tnf will run in \u2018diagnostic\u2019 mode. By default the claim file will be output into the same location as the test executable. The -o argument for run-cnf-suites.sh can be used to provide a new location that the output files will be saved to.

This is useful when debugging a single test. To select the test to be executed when running run-cnf-suites.sh with the following command-line: ./run-cnf-suites.sh -l operator-install-source Note The test labels work the same as the suite labels, so you can select more than one test with the filtering mechanism shown before. Run a subset \u00b6 You can find all the labels attached to the tests by running the following command: ./run-cnf-suites.sh --list You can also check the CATALOG.md to find all test labels. Labels for offline environments \u00b6 Some tests do require connectivity to Red Hat servers to validate certification status. To run the tests in an offline environment, skip the tests using the l option. ./run-cnf-suites.sh -l '!online' Alternatively, if an offline DB for containers, helm charts and operators is available, there is no need to skip those tests if the environment variable TNF_OFFLINE_DB is set to the DB location.
