This tool can be helpful when the result of some test cases is different between two (consecutive) runs, as it shows configuration differences in both the Test Suite config and the cluster nodes that could be the root cause for some of the test cases results discrepancy.</p> <p>All the compared sections, except the test cases results are compared blindly, traversing the whole json tree and sub-trees to get a list of all the fields and their values. Three tables are shown:</p> <ul> <li>Differences: same fields with different values.</li> <li>Fields in claim 1 only: json fields in claim file 1 that don\u2019t exist in claim 2.</li> <li>Fields in claim 2 only: json fields in claim file 2 that don\u2019t exist in claim 1.</li> </ul> <p>Let\u2019s say one of the nodes of the claim.json file contains this struct:</p> <pre><code>{\n  \"field1\": \"value1\",\n  \"field2\": {\n    \"field3\": \"value2\",\n    \"field4\": {\n      \"field5\": \"value3\",\n      \"field6\": \"value4\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n</code></pre> <p>When parsing that json struct fields, it will produce a list of fields like this:</p> <pre><code>/field1=value1\n/field2/field3=value2\n/field2/field4/field5=value3\n/field2/field4/field6=finalvalue2\n</code></pre> <p>Once this list of field\u2019s path+value strings has been obtained from both claim files, it is compared in order to find the differences or the fields that only exist on each file.</p> <p>This is a fake example of a node \u201cclus0-0\u201d whose first CNI (index 0) has a different cniVersion and the ipMask flag of its first plugin (also index 0) has changed to false in the second run.
