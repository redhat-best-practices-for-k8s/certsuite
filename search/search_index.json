These can be configured through a config file. Sample As per the requirement the following fields can be changed. targetNameSpaces \u00b6 Multiple namespaces can be specified to deploy partner pods for testing through targetNameSpaces in the config file. targetNameSpaces : - name : firstnamespace - name : secondnamespace targetPodLabels \u00b6 The goal of this section is to specify the labels to be used to identify the CNF resources under test. Highly recommended The labels should be defined in pod definition rather than added after pod is created, as labels added later on will be lost in case the pod gets rescheduled. In case of pods defined as part of a deployment, it\u2019s best to use the same label as the one defined in the spec.selector.matchLabels section of the deployment yaml. The prefix field can be used to avoid naming collision with other labels. targetPodLabels : - prefix : test-network-function.com name : generic value : target The corresponding pod label used to match pods is: test-network-function.com/generic : target Once the pods are found, all of their containers are also added to the target container list. A target deployment list will also be created with all the deployments which the test pods belong to. targetCrds \u00b6 In order to autodiscover the CRDs to be tested, an array of search filters can be set under the \u201ctargetCrdFilters\u201d label. The autodiscovery mechanism will iterate through all the filters to look for all the CRDs that match it. Currently, filters only work by name suffix. targetCrdFilters : - nameSuffix : \"group1.tnf.com\" - nameSuffix : \"anydomain.com\" The autodiscovery mechanism will create a list of all CRD names in the cluster whose names have the suffix group1.tnf.com or anydomain.com , e.g. crd1.group1.tnf.com or mycrd.mygroup.anydomain.com . testTarget \u00b6 podsUnderTest / containersUnderTest \u00b6 The autodiscovery mechanism will attempt to identify the default network device and all the IP addresses of the pods it needs for network connectivity tests, though that information can be explicitly set using annotations if needed. Pod IPs \u00b6 The k8s.v1.cni.cncf.io/networks-status annotation is checked and all IPs from it are used. This annotation is automatically managed in OpenShift but may not be present in K8s. If it is not present, then only known IPs associated with the pod are used (the pod .status.ips field). Network Interfaces \u00b6 The annotation test-network-function.com/defaultnetworkinterface is the highest priority, and must contain a JSON-encoded string of the primary network interface for the pod. This must be explicitly set if needed. Examples are provided in cnf-certification-test-partner . If the above is not present, the k8s.v1.cni.cncf.io/networks-status annotation is checked and the interface from the first entry found with \"default\"=true is used.

The label value is not important, only its presence. The label test-network-function.com/skip_multus_connectivity_tests excludes pods from Multus connectivity tests. Tests on default interface are still done. The label value is not important, but its presence. AffinityRequired \u00b6 For CNF workloads that require pods to use Pod or Node Affinity rules, the label AffinityRequired: true must be included on either the Deployment, StatefulSet, or Pod YAML. This will prevent any tests for anti-affinity to fail as well as test your workloads for affinity rules that support your CNF \u2018s use-case. certifiedcontainerinfo \u00b6 The certifiedcontainerinfo section contains information about CNFs containers that are to be checked for certification status on Red Hat catalogs.

Prerequisites for the OCP cluster The cluster should allow interactive shell sessions to pods/containers to stay alive when being idle for more than a few minutes. To enable it, consult the maintainer of the cluster infrastructure. Also, make sure the firewalls/load balancers on the path do not timeout idle connections too quickly.
